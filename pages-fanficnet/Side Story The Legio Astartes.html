<p><strong>The Legio Astartes </strong></p><p>&quot;They are my bulwark against the Terror. They are the Defenders of Humanity. They are my Space Marines and they shall know no fear.&quot;</p><hr size="1" noshade><p><strong>Crusader Fleets and Expedition Fleets </strong><br><strong><br>Crusader Fleets</strong>- The vast majority of the Legio Astartes are organized in Twenty massive forces known as the Crusader Fleets. Containing 80-90% of all Astartes in a Legion each Crusader Fleet acts as an unparalleled military force capable of waging war against any Xeno or Noncompliant Empire.</p><p>Commanded by a Primarch each Fleet is supported by multiple Titan Legions, Imperial Auxilla Regiments, and Iterator Courts. With the Legio Astartes forming the main fighting force and backbone of Crusade Fleet.</p><p>The purpose and goal of each Crusade Fleet is to eliminate major threats to the Imperium. A list of high-priority targets compiled by the Emperor was presented to each Primarch at the start of the Crusade. The lists are unique to the Primarch they were given too and the foes detailed within would fall to that Primarchs and their legions talents.</p><p>Each Crusader Fleet numbers in the hundreds of vessels, from titanic Gloriana Flagships to swarms of small escort crafts. Millions of Humans live and work in the fleet. This number includes the Fleets Legion. The Legion is required to maintain at least 500,000 Battle-Brothers and if casualties dip the number below that reinforcements from Expedition fleets will be called in.</p><p>Periodically Crusader Astartes will be deployed to Expedition fleets and vice versa. This helps prevent complacency, overtaxed forces, and intra-legion rifts. These periodic changes help disrupt the formation of possibly corrupting secret-societies and helps forge positive bonds between Astartes and baseline humans.</p><p>Organized into Ten specialized Super-Formations with unique names in each Legion the Crusader Astartes are capable of mobilizing and organizing successfully hundreds of thousands and in some cases millions of Astartes in a single battle. The Super-Formations are designed to specialize in a certain type of warfare and depending on a Legions own specialty some might be far larger than others.</p><p><strong>Expedition Fleets</strong>- Far smaller and far more numerous than the Crusader Fleets the Expedition Fleets exist as the Imperium&apos;s primary Unification force. Composed of Martian Explorators, Imperial Auxilia, Iraetor Courts and a token Astartes Force the Expedition Fleets are meant for exploration and diplomacy.</p><p>Expedition Fleets form the third wave of Imperial expansion. First Rogue Traders who often time are involved with the fleets survey and scout a galactic region. The Crusader Fleets then eliminate any major threats in the region. The Expedition fleets than mop up any lesser dangers establish contact with the region&apos;s cultures and work to integrate them into the Imperium. Expedition Fleets also give the all clear for civilian vessels from Colony ships too Mining Charters to use new Imperial Space.</p><p>Crusader Fleets are typically accompanied by several Expedition Fleets when operating between Crusade-Fronts. It is not uncommon for some of the more politically minded Primarchs too bring their Fleet during combat lulls or periods of repair and refit along with Expeditions. To help ease negotiations and tour the growing Imperium.</p><p>Unlike Crusader Fleets that are commanded by a Primarch, an expedition fleet is commanded by a human commander. These Expedition Captains as they are called are often minor Imperial celebrities and are often recruited from Terran noble houses and Auxilia officer corps. To get this command strong force of will along with extreme competence is required. They are one of the few non-Astartes that can give orders to the Emperors Angels of Death.</p><p>Each Expedition Fleet is garrisoned with a contingent of Astartes. The size of this garrison ranges from 200 to 20,000 depending on the size of the Expedition fleet and the hostility of the space they are traveling. The reason for this particular number is representatives of all twenty Legions are required in each fleet. Ranging from a single Squad to an entire Chapter.</p><hr size="1" noshade><p><strong>Rank</strong><br>(This is a generalized system with sub-ranks and specialty ranks existing in various Legions. Such as Marshal-Lieutenants, Chapter Commander, etc)</p><p><em>Neophyte</em>- An Astartes in training. Lacking some Implants but combat ready. Organized into Training companies presided over by Scout Sergeants. Training companies duties depend on Legion. Ranging from scout work to being apprenticed under a Battle-Brother.</p><p><em>Battle Brother-</em> Rank and File Astartes that have completed their Training and assigned to a Super-Formation. Organized into Ten Man squads that act as a close-knit unit. Some battle brothers with particular talents are removed from the normal chain of command and become a Specialist that exist outside of typical squad command.</p><p><em>Marshal-Sergeant</em>- Officer and leader of a Battle-Brother Squad. Typically the eldest of the Squad with the most experience. The Veterans of hundreds of battles a Marshal-Sergeant will be sometimes be reassigned to train Neophytes as a Scout-Sergeant.</p><p>C<em>aptain</em>- Officer of a Hundred Battle-Brother strong Company. Each is a skilled commander capable of making independent decisions and leading a company into battle. Captains are also the lowest rank capable of commanding a vessel or an Expedition Contingent. If less than a company of each legion is deployed to an Expedition Fleet a Captain will be selected to have operational command over all the Astartes.</p><p><em>Chapter Master</em>- Elite officers who are in charge of commanding ten companies and all required support staff. These are the commanders of the Legio Astartes who direct battles and command respect. Chapter Masters are typically elected by a Chapters Captains but it&apos;s not unheard of them being appointed by higher-ups in times of emergency.</p><p><em>Lord Commander</em>- The Generals of the Legio Astartes, they command Cohorts and excel at getting multiple Super-Formations to work together in unison. Trusted by their Primarch with command over an entire theater of operations.</p><p><em>Battlemaster</em>- Handpicked by the Legions Primarch to lead a Super-Formation. These Space Marines are absolute masters of a certain type of warfare.</p><p><em>Primarch</em>- The Gene Father and absolute commander of a legion. Second only to the Emperor himself in military matters.</p><hr size="1" noshade><p><strong>Basic Combat Organization</strong></p><p><strong>Squadron-</strong> A Space Marine squad is composed of nine battle brothers and a Sergeant. The Astartes fight together as a unit and will fight and die for each other. Squads can either be specialist squads consisting of a single loadout or diversified squads of varying loadouts.</p><p><strong>Company</strong>- Composed of ten squads, twenty support Astartes, and a Captain. Form the basic combat force of an Astartes and are designed to be equally effective operating independently or part of a larger force. A Company is trained to be able to rapidly shift from self-sufficient commando force to specialized military battalion. As such Companies are typically formed of squads with similar and complementary skills.</p><p><strong>Chapter</strong>- Ten Companies and support ranging from Armor columns to assigned Auxilia Regiments form a Legio Astartes Chapter. Similar to the companies that compose them Chapters are meant to be able to operate as independent armies or part of a specialized formation. Chapters typically are given nicknames based on their unique characteristics and specialties.</p><p><strong>Cohort</strong>- Five to fifty Chapters of Astartes working together as a single army. Typically composed of multiple super-formation Chapters working in concert to support each other. In rare cases, a Cohort of a single Super-Formation may be deployed as needed though. A Cohort forms a theatre of operations for an Astartes Legion and its size varies on the intensity and importance of said conflict.</p><p><strong>Super Formation</strong>- A large number of specialized Chapters unified together into a single Legion-wide formation. Can be deployed in its entirety under a Battlemaster with Lord Commander lieutenant or in part under an appointed Lord Commander Designed to operate on massive battlefields against millions of foes the Super-Formations allow the skills of its Legion to be used to its fullest. While smaller deployments are designed to be both special forces and part of a larger army the Super-Formations are meant to fight solely as part of a legion, reliant on other Formations and much more specialized.</p><hr size="1" noshade><p><strong>The Super-Formations </strong></p><p><strong>The First Formation</strong>-<strong>Elites</strong> Amazingly skilled warriors selected for the most difficult duties and missions. Unlike the other formations, they are not assigned from training but are elevated to the First Formation after displays of martial skill, valor and legion values. Armed and equipped with the finest wargear available to the Legion masters of every skill set used in legion make up the First Formation. In combat, the First Formation is often used as an elite strike force to turn the tide of a battle or end it decisively. Out of combat they often have the duty of forming honor guards and attending diplomatic functions as a demonstration of Imperial force. The Astartes of the first formation are the most likely to fight alongside their Primarch, and typically two to three chapters of this formation are always deployed alongside their genefather.</p><p><strong>The Second Formation</strong>-<strong>Warsuits.</strong> Each member is armored head to toe in Advanced Power Armor. Smaller than most other Formations due to limited numbers of tactical dreadnought armor, Centurion suits, and Dreadknights. Specialize in wading into the thickest of the fighting to inflict and take massive amounts of damage. Heavily armed and armored for spear tip strikes and frontal assaults. The Second Formation is deployed in two manners. In units of heavy shock troopers or single troops deployed within other formations to provide support.</p><p><strong>The Third Formation</strong>- <strong>Fast Attack</strong>. Composed of Bike Cavalry and Jetpack specialists the Third Formation strikes hard and fast. Prizing mobility and efficiency the third Formation&apos;s duties is to start a battle on the Imperiums terms and keep the enemy formation broken. Fast Attack war-bikes and Jet-Bikes typically form a lighting fast blitz-force capable of ripping through the enemy line and opening them up to further attacks. The Jump Infantry of the Third Formation is sometimes deployed alongside their cavalry brothers to decimate disoriented pockets of enemies. At other times they are deployed piecemeal throughout the battle to act as fast-moving reinforcements to patch breaks in the battle-lines or harass enemy flanks.</p><p><strong>The Fourth Formation</strong>- <strong>Armored Assault.</strong> The Fourth Formation operates the armored transports and tanks of the Legion. Transporting troops to the front lines and using the crushing power of heavy tanks to break the enemy are the duties of the Fourth formation. Each legions fleet of battle tanks, APC&apos;s and skimmers is operated by the Fourth Formation to great effect. Some of the more mechanized Legions like the IV and X boast massive numbers of these vehicles and equally large Fourth Formations to operate them. Different Legions prefer to use the Fourth Formation in unique ways. Some prefer the armored tank-lines be used independently to engage a blitzkrieg strategy. Others prefer the more reliable force multiplying effect of them supporting infantry.</p><p><strong>The Fifth Formation</strong>- <strong>Basic Infantry</strong>. Almost always the largest Formation the Basic Infantry form the core of a Legion. These are the battle-brothers holding the line and doing the majority of the fighting. Composed of Astartes lacking the skills or interest to join one of the more specialized formations the Fifth Formation is known for being more adaptable and more efficient than its siblings. Where other formations might win a battle the Basic Infantry wins Wars. Equipped similarly to expedition fleet chapters they wield Standard Issue weapons, armor, and equipment. This formations squads similar to a Chapters can share a single loadout or have more diversified one&apos;s per battle-brother and war-zone need.</p><p><strong>The Sixth Formation</strong>- <strong>Close Quarter Combat</strong>. Brutal warriors whose Modus operandi involves getting into the thickest of the fighting and reaping a grim toll upon the foe. By nature of their role, the Sixth Formation suffers higher casualties than virtually any other on average. This is counterbalanced by its atypical recruitment numbers. Many young battle-brothers seek to bloody themselves up close to the xeno-hordes. This is also the reason it is one of the most transferred out of formations. Veterans typically mature past their bloodlust and seek to serve the Imperium in other ways. Typically work closely with the Fifth Formation in holding the front lines.</p><p><strong>The Seventh Formation</strong>- <strong>Destroyers</strong>. The grimmest and most brutal Formation the Seventh hold the combat role of heavy weapon and total warfare specialists. Collateral damage is an inevitable part of warfare. The other formations acknowledge this and seek to minimize it, this is not the case with the Seventh. Extremely destructive weaponry and relentless extermination are the duties of this formation. Like the second formation, they are typically deployed piecemeal throughout other formations to support them with overwhelming firepower and for the other formation to keep them in check. In the rare cases where the raw annihilating power of the Seventh is needed in its entirety, they can assemble and reduce cities to ash.</p><p><strong>The Eighth Formation</strong>- <strong>Void Specialists</strong>. Legio Astartes translates to Legion of the Stars, this is the origin of the coequal civilian term for the Emperors Angels: The Space Marines. Void warfare is a brutal unforgiving practice that the Eighth Formation is designed to handle. Divided into two rough sub-formations the Eighth form both a Legions pilots for their transport and attack crafts, while also performing boarding operations. Either piloting a Stormbird, or marching through an enemy vessel hallway stormshield in hand the Eighth Formation ensure the Imperium alone is master of the Void. The Armor and weapons of the Eighth Formation are designed to allow effective fighting in the confines of Voidships and surviving the dangers of collapsing vessels and the unforgiving void.</p><p><strong>The Ninth Formation</strong>- <strong>Defensive Warfare</strong>. War is Hell, the Ninth Formation know that better than most and are meant to not only survive but thrive in that environment. The building and garrisoning of Fortresses falls to the Ninth Formation. Attrition warfare, artillery and defending a Legions supply lines also fall under the Ninth formations purview. This leads to a somber and pragmatic attitude to these heavily armed and armored battle brothers. While other formations may capture territory the Ninth ensures they keep that territory.</p><p><strong>The Tenth Formation</strong>- <strong>Specialists and Logistics</strong>. Not so much a single formation but a blanket term to cover and classify the countless specialists and support-Astartes that operate inside a Legion. These include the Libarius, Chaplaincy Corp, Tech-Marines, Apothecaries, Emperors Talons detachment, Silver Order Detachment, Muster Chiefs, Scouts and the neophytes. The training and recruitment of new Astartes for the Legion falls under the Tenth Formations duties. Once they finish their training in the Tenth they are assigned to another formation or expedition fleet.</p><hr size="1" noshade><p><strong>Gene-Seed</strong></p><p>Of all the Transhuman abilities that empower the Emperor&apos;s sons, one stands above the others. The Legion-Forge organ of the Primarchs saturates the Primarchs bloodstream with proto-prognoids. These can be extracted and cultivated into Gene-Seed. A series of psycho-genetic implants that transform a baseline human into a physically, genetically and spiritually superhuman warrior. The Implant series augments the mortal&apos;s physical body to levels only matched by the greatest Gene-Warriors of the Golden Age. Their genome is subtly reprogrammed to better resist the horrors of the cosmos and allow the Astartes body to use the implants successfully. Their very soul is strengthened and linked to their Primarch and the Emperor himself in a minute way.</p><p>Only baseline or class-A mutants possessing an XY chromosome can undergo the transformation. The chances of success are directly related to the genetic and psychological makeup of the initiate. Different strains of Geneseed have different compatibility with different phenotypes and cultures. With applicants whose background correlates to that Primarchs gene and spiritual aspect having better odds.</p><p>There are a number of phenomena related to Astartes gene-seed that only occur in rare cases. Overshadowing as it is known is the most common of these phenomena and will typically occur to most Astartes over their lifetime. The physical traits of there Primarch will start to replace the Astartes original features. All Astartes experience this to a certain extent when they are forged and it usually intensifies with age. Some Legions like the III and XVI experience much more intensely than others. Gene-syncing is the other and much rarer phenoanaoma. Very few individuals with unique genetic and psychic affinity to the geneseed will undergo this effect. The Geneseed, in essence, is better accepted and incorporated into their biology at such a level they become something more than an Astartes and more like a lesser version of their Primarch.</p><p><strong>The Organs</strong></p><p>Second Heart- This simplest and most self-sufficient of implants allows a Space Marine to survive his other heart being damaged or destroyed, and to survive in low oxygen environments. Not just a back-up, the secondary heart can boost the blood-flow around the Marine&apos;s body.</p><p>Ossmodula- A small, complex, tubular organ, the ossmodula secretes hormones that both affect the ossification of the skeleton and encourages the forming bone growths to absorb ceramic-based chemicals that are laced into the Marine&apos;s diet.[1][2a][3] This drastically alters the way a Space Marine&apos;s bones grow and develop. Two years after this implant is first put in the subject&apos;s long bones will have increased in size and strength (along with most other bones), and the rib cage will have been fused into a solid mass of bulletproof, interlocking plates.</p><p>Biscopea- This small, circular organ is inserted into the chest cavity and releases hormones that vastly increase muscle growth throughout the marine&apos;s body. It also serves to form the hormonal basis for many of the later implants.</p><p>Sinew Coils- Known as the Steel Within, the Space Marne&apos;s sinews are reinforced with durametallic coil-cables that contract with incredible force, magnifying the subjects strength beyond that of a regular Space Marine and giving another layer of interior defense.</p><p>Magnificat- this small thumbnail-sized lobe is inserted into the brain&apos;s core. The implant secretes hormones that increase the body&apos;s growth functions while also intensifying its advanced systems, especially for the ossmodula and biscopea. In truth, this implant is but half of the true, dual-valve immmortis gland (the &quot;God-Maker&quot;) which the Emperor made for the Primarchs.</p><p>Revitalizer- his dormant organ connects to both hearts. In times of extreme stress or trauma, it expels self-manufactured chemical similar to combat stimms that also aids in regeneration. After activation the gland will fall dormant again, taking some time to build up itself for activation once more</p><p>Haemastamen- Implanted into the main circulatory system, this tiny implant not only increases the haemoglobin content of the subject&apos;s blood, making it more efficient at carrying oxygen around the body and making the subject&apos;s blood a bright red.</p><p>Larraman&apos;s Organ- A liver-shaped organ about the size of a golf-ball, this implant is placed within the chest cavity and connected to the circulatory system. It generates and controls &apos;Larraman cells&apos; which are released into the bloodstream if the recipient is wounded. They attach themselves to leucocytes in the blood and are carried to the site of the wound, whereupon contact with air they form a near instant patch of scar tissue, sealing any wounds the Space Marine may suffer.</p><p>Catalepsean Node- Implanted into the back of the brain, this pea-sized organ influences the circadian rhythms of sleep and the body&apos;s response to sleep deprivation. If deprived of sleep, the catalepsean node cuts in. The node allows a Marine to sleep and remain awake at the same time by switching off areas of his brain sequentially. This process cannot replace sleep entirely but increases the Marines survivability by allowing perception of the environment while resting[1][2a][3]. This means that a Space Marine needs no more than 4 hours of sleep a day, and can potentially go for 2 weeks without any sleep at all</p><p>Dohrnii Drive- A small gland inserted into the brain stem. It stays dormant for the rest of an Astartes creation and is only activated with certain hormonal signatures once the Astartes reaches full maturity. Once activated it secretes a mapping-polymer that forms a non-interfering coat upon the Space Marines nerves. The polymer transmits the neural patterns and activity back to the Dohrnii Drive where the information is stored along with other biological data intercepted from the brain stream. If the nerves or tissues coated by the Drive are damaged it will use the saved data to assist the Astartes healing process in restoring them to peak condition. This allows an Astartes with sufficient time and nutrients to heal from even the most grievous wounds as long as the Dohrnii Drive and brainstem remain intact.</p><p>Preomnor- Is essentially a pre-stomach that can neutralize otherwise poisonous or indigestible foods. No actual digestion takes place in the preomnor, as it acts as a decontamination chamber placed before the natural stomach in the body&apos;s system and can be isolated from the rest of the digestive tract in order to contain particularly troublesome intake. This intake is then purified allowing the Astartes to gain nutrients from even the most unexpected sources.</p><p>Omophagea- allows a Space Marine to &apos;learn by eating&apos;. It is situated in the spinal cord but is actually part of the brain. Four nerve bundles are implanted connecting the spine and the stomach wall. Able to &apos;read&apos; or absorb genetic material consumed by the marine, the omophagea transmits the gained information to the Marine&apos;s brain as a set of memories or experiences. It also helps assists form the Astartes eidetic memory.</p><p>Multi-lung- This additional lung activates when a Space Marine needs to breathe in low-oxygen or poisoned atmospheres, and even water. The natural lungs are closed off by a sphincter muscle associated with the multi-lung and the implanted organ takes over breathing operations. It has highly efficient toxin dispersal systems</p><p>Occulobe- This implant sits at the base of the brain, and provides hormonal and genetic stimuli which enable a Marine&apos;s eyes to respond to optic-therapy. This, in turn, allows the Apothecaries to make adjustments to the growth patterns of the eye and the light-receptive retinal cells - the result being that Space Marines have far superior vision to normal humans, and can see in low-light conditions almost as well as in daylight</p><p>Lyman&apos;s Ear- Not only does this implant make a Space Marine immune from dizziness or motion sickness but also allows Space Marines to consciously filter out and enhance certain sounds. The Lyman&apos;s Ear completely replaces a Marine&apos;s original ear. It is externally indistinguishable from a normal human ear.</p><p>Sus-an Membrane- Initially implanted above the brain, this membrane eventually merges with the recipient&apos;s entire brain. Ineffective without follow-up chemical therapy and training, but with sufficient training a Space Marine can use this implant to enter a state of suspended animation, consciously or as an automatic reaction to extreme trauma, keeping the Marine alive for years, even if he has suffered otherwise mortal wounds. Only the appropriate chemical therapy or auto-suggestion can revive a Marine from this state. Linked to the Dohrnii Drive to start the process of extreme regeneration while in suspended animation.</p><p>Melanchromic Organ- This implant controls the amount of melanin in a Marine&apos;s skin. Exposure to high levels of sunlight will result in the Marine&apos;s skin darkening to compensate. It also protects the Marine from other forms of radiation</p><p>Oolitic Kidney- In conjunction with the secondary heart, this implant allows a Space Marine to filter his blood very quickly, rendering him immune to most poisons. This action comes at a price, however, as this emergency detoxification usually renders the Marine unconscious while his blood is circulated at high speed. The organ&apos;s everyday function is to monitor the entire circulatory system and allow other organs to function effectively</p><p>Neuroglottis- This enhances a Space Marine&apos;s sense of taste to such a high degree that he can identify many common chemicals by taste alone. A Marine can even track down his target by taste and smell.</p><p>Mucranoid- This implant allows a Space Marine to sweat a substance that coats the skin and offers resistance to extreme heat and cold and can even provide some protection for the marine in a vacuum.</p><p>Betcher&apos;s Gland- Consists of two identical glands, implanted either into the lower lip, alongside the salivary glands or into the hard palette. The gland works in a similar way to the poison gland of venomous reptiles by synthesizing and storing deadly poison, which the Marines themselves are immune to due to the gland&apos;s presence. This allows a Space Marine to spit a blinding contact poison. The poison is also corrosive and can even burn away strong metals given sufficient time.</p><p>Progenoids- here are two of these glands, one situated in the neck and the other within the chest cavity. These glands are vitally important and represent the future of the Legion, as the only way new gene-seed can be produced is by reproducing it within the bodies of the Marines themselves. This is the implant&apos;s only purpose. The glands absorb genetic material from the other implanted organs. When they have matured each gland will have developed a single gene-seed corresponding to each of the zygotes which have been implanted into the Marine. The Neck Progenoid can be harvested every five years but the chest one is only harvestable one at Death.</p><p>Black Carapace- The most distinctive implant, it resembles a film of black plastic that is implanted directly beneath the skin of the Marine&apos;s torso in sheets. It hardens on the outside and sends invasive neural bundles into the Marine&apos;s body. After the organ has matured the recipient is then fitted with neural sensors and interface points cut into the carapace&apos;s surface. This allows a Space Marine to interface directly with his Power Armour. Without the Black Carapace, many of the systems of the power armour will not function. While driving the vehicles of the Chapter, special spinal interface plugged into power armour and Black Carapace to provide the Space Marine an intuitive &apos;feel&apos; for vehicles systems and controls, literally making him a part of his vehicle</p><p>Legion Unique Organ- each Gene-line possess a unique Organ that further enhances that lineages specialties. The time of implantation varies with the organ. The organs are based on the unique augmentations of each Primarch possess and allows the Astartes to tap into the smallest bit of their Primarchs incredible abilities.</p><hr size="1" noshade><p><strong>Specialty Astartes</strong></p><p><em>The Librarius</em></p><p>Psychic powers are one of the more dangerous and powerful tools available to the Legions. Astartes initiates who display Psychic potential are drafted into the Librarius once their basic training finishes. To better protect them from the Warps influence each new Acolytum (apprentice Librarian) is psychically bonded to the highest ranking present Librarian. Helping create a chain of souls from the Chief Librarian all the way to the freshest recruit. This allows the Librarians of the Legio Astartes to better resist the warps taint and draw upon experience and power of their seniors.</p><p>The Librarius is typically treated with wary respect by the rest of the legions for the powers they wield are great and so are the dangers they face. Some legions have larger Librarius simply due to Gene-Seed perculities. These include the XV which is almost entirely psychically active and the IX which possesses a Legion wide psychic connection. When a new Chief Librarian is selected by the Legions Primarch they are ritually bound with a drop of the Primarchs blood, making the Legions soul-chain far more resistant to the taint of Chaos.</p><p>The Libarius is subdivided into various orders of Psychic specialties. Librarians like all psykers tend to gravitate to a certain type of warp-manipulation. The Basic Schools of the Libarius are as such. The Order of Force that specializes in the manipulation of the elements and matter via telekinesis, pyrokinesis and their kin arts. The Order of the Mind deals with the manipulation of minds and bodies. This includes telepathy, biokinesis, and technopathy. Lastly is the Order of Souls which teaches the arts of Divination, Runes, and Sanctic Daemonology. Battle-Brothers of the Libariaus have their armor marked to indicate the arts they specialize in.</p><p><em>The Chaplaincy Corps</em></p><p>Astartes may be superhuman but they are indeed at their core human. As such mortal failings and the stress of war can affect even them. It is the duty of the Chaplaincy Corps to help their battle-brothers in these times of need. Charismatic and wise the Chaplains provide guidance and counsel to their brothers off the battlefield, and righteous fury an unshakable resolve to aspire too on the battlefield.</p><p>One of the duties of the Chaplaincy is to oversee the social activities and off-duty conduct of Astartes. Most legions possess some sort of internal organization for bonding and decompression. The Chaplains ensure these organizations stay within Imperial guidelines and do not act as corrupters. Astartes who are corrupted by Warp or Xeno taint are also the duty of the Chaplains, be it overseeing their redemption or leading Euthanizer-Squads to hunt down the traitors.</p><p><em>Tech Marines</em></p><p>Those with particular mechanical talent are drafted into the Tech Marines. Here Astartes are instructed by the Tech-Priests of Mars on the proper maintenance, and manufacturing of the Legions equipment. The Armor and Weapons of a Legion are typically built at Forge Worlds but are modified and upgraded to a Legions specifics by the Tech Marines. More unique artifacts or custom items of a Legion are almost always created and maintained by the Tech Marines though.</p><p>On the Battlefield the Tech Marines typically ensure the working of equipment and do emergency repairs when needed. The deployment of equipment and vehicles also falls under the purview of Tech Marines. Drop-Pods and Drop-Ships deploying that equipment are accompanied by a Tech-Marine to ensure maximum performance. Tech-Marines also work with a squad of tech-priests which can number from two to hundreds. This varies on the rank, skill, and intensity of the Tech Marines current project. Engiseer members of these Assistant-Priests also serve alongside the Tech Marines on the battlefield</p><p><em>Apothecaries</em></p><p>Geneseed is the lifeblood of a Legion. The care and harvesting of this precious substance along with the caring for a Legions injured are the duties of the Apothecarium. Legion Apothecaries harvest Gene-Seed from three different sources, the Legions Primarch, the Legions Dead and an Astartes neck Prognoids which can be harvested every five years. The secrets of Astartes creation are kept by the Apothecarium. The care of Geneseed and the creation of the Astartes are the primary duty of the Apothecarium. While the treatment of injuries and overseeing the health of the Legion are their secondary duties.</p><p>On the battlefield, Apothecaries act as a combat medic and when necessary euthanizers. For even with the great regenerative abilities of the Astartes, the Emperor&apos;s peace is sometimes the only option available. Apothecaries tend to gravitate towards the duties of Astartes-Smith or Combat-Medic and will as their carrier continues usually end up specializing as one or the other.</p><p><em>Scouts</em></p><p>Information wins wars, that tenet is possibly even more true with the Transhuman Astartes. Much of the information not collected by Servitor-Drones or Orbital scans come from the Astartes Scouts. Experts in stealth, asymmetrical warfare, and information gathering the scouts form the Legions primary recon and harassment force. Equipped with modified or stripped down power-armor that trades protection for stealth the Scouts are rarely seen on the battlefield, let alone the front lines. More often they work to harass supply-lines, eliminate key targets and keep HQ up to date on enemy movements.</p><p>Some Legions use the Scouts as the last segment of their neophyte training instead of having them as their own separate standing force. This gives the young Astartes combat experience while teaching them the subtle aspects of warfare. Even in these Legions, Scout-Sergeants are sometimes assembled into special operations squads known as Kill-Teams. These experienced operators are entrusted with the riskiest missions requiring surgical skill and stealth.</p><p><em>Muster Chiefs</em></p><p>An army marches on its stomach. The Astartes Muster Chiefs are the masters of logistics Supplies and commanders of servants. Trans-Human Cogitars of incredible intellectual might and mathematical skill the logistics needed to run a galactic campaign are handled by them. Managing the human support staff of a legion, ranging from armory serfs to the Imperial Auxilla assigned to a Legion. Recruited from neophytes with great mathematical, problem-solving and mortal liaison skills the Muster Chiefs put their superhuman bodies and minds to the science of warfare.</p><p>While more often found in the stock-pile zones and Cogitator centers of the Legion the Muster Chiefs are still Astartes and can be found on the battlefield. Auxillia regiments deployed alongside the Legions are deployed with one Muster chief as Astartes emissary and as a commanding officer outside the normal chain of command. Here they ensure the purity and loyalty of the regiment. Foreven the most battle-tested mortals lack protection from spiritual and physical threats an Astartes is immune too.</p><hr size="1" noshade><p><strong>Legion Detachments </strong></p><p>The Legio Astartes do not fight their wars alone. Other armies and fighting forces accompany and assist the Legions in their crusades. These range in size and vary between each legion. With some Legions possessing massive detachments and others the bare minimum. Below are the most common and important of the Legions.</p><p><em>The Talons of the Emperor</em></p><p>Each legion competes with each other to prove themselves the greatest Astartes fighting force in the Galaxy. Some will even go as far to say they are the mightiest Legion and second greatest warriors in the galaxy. None except the most foolishly boastful would ever claim to be the greatest. For the Talons of the Emperor are beyond comparison. A Single Shield-Company of a hundred Custodes and a Vigil of a thousand Sisters of Silence are deployed with Each Legion. They are the Emperors Talons and protect his servants while bringing death to his enemies.</p><p>The Talons are typically deployed alongside the First Formation, acting as guardians for the Primarch and the Legions elite. Here they serve as an ever-present reminder of the Emperor&apos;s power and influence. Yet this powerful tool at the Primarchs disposal is a double-edged sword. For they are an unspoken threat against any who would betray the Emperor. Very few things could kill a Primarch, a hundred Custodes and a Thousand Sisters of Silence are one of those things.</p><p>Despite being technically deployed as an asset of a Legion the Talons are the Emperors servants first and foremost. It is not uncommon for a segment or even the entirety of a Legions detachment to suddenly leave on a shadowy mission from the Master of Mankind himself. These missions can last for days to years and range from tracking down a specific artifact of great importance to eliminating a threat none can ever know of.</p><p><em>The Collegia Titanica</em></p><p>Few things can withstand the might of the Emperors Angels of Death. The Imperium has weapons to face these threats, and chief among them are the Titan Legions. The Martian God-Machines are an army of walking exterminatus. Deployed in only the most extreme circumstances the Titans obliterate all who stand against them. A single Titan Legion is deployed with each Astartes Legion and provide destructive support beyond even the Astartes armor divisions.</p><p>Each Legion varies in size and number of each Titan. The minimum is a single Capital Class Titan, Five Battle Titans, and ten Scout Titans. The size can increase exponentially upwards with a few Legions being able to field hundreds of God-machines. Skitarii and other Mechanicum forces are also deployed alongside the Titans as they would be in any other warzone. As such Mechanicum Forge-Ships are a hallmark of Crusader fleets. Transporting, supporting and repairing them and the Legions mechanical aspects.</p><p>When the crusade first started the Legions Titan detachments were composed of loaned units from Mars. As the crusade continued and more and more Forge Worlds were found or founded Titans became a somewhat more common sight across the Great Crusade. Eventually, each Astartes Legion gained a sworn Collegia Titanica that existed solely to assist the Legion. These Legions are supplied by Forge Worlds who arm and armor that Legion. The Xth legion was the first to earn a Sworn-Legion. The Talos-Adamants of the Forge World Columnus.</p><p><em>The Imperial Auxilia</em></p><p>While the Legio Astartes form the Imperium Sword and Spear the Imperial Auxilia make up its armor and shield. Recruited from compliant worlds the Imperial Auxilia keep the peace and ensure loyalty on planets across the Imperium. A very small percentage of Auxilia regiments will be sent to fight on the frontlines alongside the Astartes. These better trained and better-equipped regiments known as the Solar Auxilia support the Legions on the battlefield. They guard supply lines, mop up surviving enemy resistance and provide fire-support for the Astartes.</p><p>Solar Auxilia regiments support the Legio Astartes Crusader Fleets but form the main combat force of Expedition Fleets. As such the first exposure to the Imperium&apos;s armed forces is often the Solar Auxilia. Because of this the Auxillia is drilled to perfection and equipped with the best available baseline equipment. In order to leave a favorable if intimidating impression of the Imperium.</p><p>On the battlefield with the Astartes, the Auxilia play various roles. From providing covering fire to the Legionaries. To finishing off enemies before they can regroup and encircle the rapidly advancing Astartes. Sometimes they act as an anvil for the Astartes hammer. Holding them in place with grit and steel when the Emperor&apos;s Angels rain death upon them. In brutal grinding battles, they often patch the battle lines and bolster flagging flanks. Allowing the Astartes to regroup and strike.</p><p>The number of Regiments assigned to a Legion varies, typically a Solar Cohort (120,000 Troops) per 50,000 Legionaries. This number was flexible, with some mass-infantry specializing Legions having a 1:1 Ratio of Solar Regiments (5,300) to Astartes Chapters. Solar Cohorts often earn titles related to their accomplishments. The ones assigned to the Legio Astartes names are typically related to their assigned Legions. Like the Plutonian Elite serving under the Solar Wardens VII Legion.</p><p><em>The Iterator Corps and Other Civilian organizations </em></p><p>The Great Crusade was more than a military campaign. It was the reunification of mankind&apos;s lost colonies. The vast majority of encountered human civilizations were peaceful isolated communities living in fear of the galaxies horror. It was the duty of the Legions to slay those horrors and the duty of the Iterator Corp to convince these worlds to join the Imperium.</p><p>Composed of the charismatic Iterators, who could convince entire worlds to join the Imperium with a single speech. Countless civilizations peacefully joined the Imperium, happy to be unified with the Cradle-World once again. The Iterator Corp was formed by Advocate-Primus of the Imperial Truth Uriah Olathaire. The various sub-orders of the Corps can also be traced to the specialties of some of his earliest disciples and projects. Like the anti-theistic Neologians or the Webspinners, masters of political manipulation.</p><p>Civilians can be found throughout the Expedition and Crusader Fleets. Tech-Priests hunting for lost knowledge, servants ensuring the day to day running of things, and other more specialized groups. A prime example is the Remembrancer Order. A pet project of Malcador and the Emperor himself the Remembrancers record the Crusade for posterity. Much was lost in the Age of Strife. Including the vast majority of human history. That tragedy will not be allowed to be repeated.</p><p><em>The Silver Order and the Silver Knights</em></p><p>*REDACTED ON ORDERS FROM THE MASTER OF MANKIND*</p><p>(All will be revealed when the horrors of Luna are unleashed)</p>
