<p><em><strong>Book II: The Great Crusade</strong></em></p><p><strong>Chapter Twenty-Two: Rising from the Ashes</strong><br>Location: Komorokh System, Centuari Cluster</p><p>Date: 884.M30</p><p>For decades, the Great Crusade had raged across the Galaxy. The Imperium of Man conquered, discovered and liberated thousands of systems. Twenty Primarch, each leading a Legion of Angels, struck down countless foes. It was a time of hope and courage, not yet darkened by the dreadful Xenocides that marked the latter Crusade. Humanity rapidly blossomed, shedding the terror of Old Night and embracing the manifest destiny the Emperor sought to craft. The exploits of his Primarchs grew legendary as well, with each Crusader Fleet accomplishing mighty deeds.</p><p>Of all the Crusader Fleets, one stood above all others: the Emperor&apos;s personal fleet, Crusader Fleet Zero. Crewed by the Talons of the Emperor, contingents of the twenty Astartes Legions, and the elite of all Imperial war-trades, Crusader Fleet Zero went wherever the Master of Mankind was needed most. Secret missions to fill the Shadow Cells of Terra, sensitive diplomatic opportunities, and turning the tide of crucial battles.</p><p>The Primarchs would all at various times be accompanied by Fleet Zero. Sometimes for days, other times for years. Having the Emperor fight alongside a Legion was an honor beyond measure. His very presence pushed its warriors to impossible heights. Factoring in his intellect and martial prowess, no foe could stand against the Emperor and whichever son he traveled with.</p><p>In the year of 884.M30, the Emperor fought alongside the III Legion and its Primarch Iskandar Basileus. The white-haired, purple-eyed Adonis of a Demigod, had already sculpted a legend of dashing hero and cultured war prince across the Imperium. Similarly, the III Legion was renowned for its unique blend of martial perfection and political acumen. The potent geneseed of Iskandar combined with Apothecary Primus Fabius&apos; skill had created a Legion of miniature versions of their Primarch.</p><p>Fabius&apos;s skill is without equal among Astartes. So even with the III&apos;s harsh requirements for possible neophytes, they grew into one of the largest Legions. This was balanced by the secondary role of the III Legion. Nearly a third of its battle brothers were deployed across the galaxy as Guard-Aides to Imperial Officials and diplomats. There, they provided polite, charming, and highly deadly reminders of the Imperium&apos;s potency. As such, the III Legion became a public face for the Legio Astartes, and were renowned for their high rate of peaceful or at least minimally violent compliances. This was the reason the Emperor chose the III Legion to accompany him for an endeavor that would require the Imperium&apos;s finest diplomatic skill and in the worst case, their precision warfare abilities.</p><p>Crusader Fleets Zero and III journeyed into the Centauri Cluster, a patch of dense stars long inhabited by humans on the border of Segmentum Tempestus and Pacificus. Here, ancient colonies and long lost techno-relics could be found, including the world of Proxima. The planet held unique interest to the Emperor. In the God-Emperor&apos;s timeline, he had been struck low on that world. A Vortex Grenade wrapped in the tanned skin of a Pariah had severely damaged his physical body.</p><p>Petty vengeance for another reality&apos;s slight was beneath the Master of Mankind. He sought Proxima for two reasons. First, to acquire the Vortex Weaponry STC hidden upon the world. The God-Emperor had claimed it for his Talons and burned the world to hide the discovery from the Mechanicum and Legions. Second, he wanted to test exactly how far history had changed from the Chaos-claimed timeline.</p><p>The dense nature of the Centauri Cluster along with the Warp&apos;s madness made time flow differently upon Proxima. Where a few decades since the point of differentiation had passed on Sol, entire centuries had gone by in the Proxima System. This was common across the galaxy. Time is relative and passed at different rates across the galaxy. Astropathic Choirs had the unique ability to somewhat synchronize systems by sharing psychic visions, allowing some level of stability in Imperial held space. So the two Crusader Fleets traveled to the cluster, hunting for secrets both old and new.</p><p>Guided by the Emperor&apos;s light the fleet entered the cluster at the edge of a system home to human colonists before Old Night known as Komorokh. Almost immediately upon exiting the Warp, the Auspex howled with contacts. The system was alive with void-ships. The human colonies of Komorokh System had survived the terrors of Strife and were thriving. Two habitable worlds and dozens of outposts across the system shone on the holo-display. Astropathic readings also picked up low-level warp disturbance. The kind that was characteristic of system hopping Warp jumps. This system was not alone. The Cluster was home to an alliance of human systems, and the Imperium had arrived at their doorstep.</p><p>As the Crusader Fleets fully exited the Warp and the veil shuttered close, thousands upon thousands of signal exploded into the Fleets comm arrays. The Imperium had arrived with a military force to conquer entire sectors. The civilization automatically assumed the worst and its stations and ships closest to the Mandeville Point issued challenge hails to the Bucephalus, accurately guessing the largest and most golden vessel led the Fleet.</p><p>The binary messages were close enough to Techna Lingua to allow easy translation. They all could be reduced to three questions. &quot;Who are you? Where are you from? What is your purpose?&quot;</p><p>Great engines of calculation and psychic manipulation surged within the Bucephalus. The Cognatu Ferrum studied the countless transmissions and vox traffic to translate the systems&apos; language. It needed to be perfect, for the slightest error could lead to tragic diplomatic consequences. The great psychic intelligence concluded the tongue spoken was a descendent of standard Terran, itself a distant cousin to Imperial Gothic like most languages spoken across the human colonies. Information of this newly acquired dialect was shared across the fleet and transmitted to the Emperor and Iskandar.</p><p>At his father&apos;s orders, the III Primarch addressed the Komorokh System as a whole, his transhuman mind mastering the systems language as fast as the Cognatu Ferrum could transmit it. In a strong yet melodic voice, Iskandar Basilius proclaimed &quot;We are the Imperium of Man. We come from Ancient Terra to fulfill the dream of unity.&quot;</p><p>Terra, humanity&apos;s homeworld. The world from where mankind once ruled the stars. Remembered in half-forgotten myths across a thousand worlds and cultures. In the millennia of the Old Night, people would cry out to Mother Terra for salvation, desperate for long-gone heroes and secrets to save them. Now, after many long ages, those cries were answered.</p><p>Slowly, so as to not startle the shocked system, the Imperial Fleet glided towards the inhabited worlds. The titanic might of the Imperium was displayed for the system to see. The two Crusader Fleets were each composed of hundreds of beautifully crafted vessels. By contrast, the sub-light craft of the system&apos;s inhabitants were simple scavenged things. Curiously painted in bright motley colors in kaleidoscopic arrangements.</p><p>The Bucephalus soon entered the orbit of the chief Komorokhan world. With the local government&apos;s permission, a diplomatic party teleported down into the prime government complex. In a flash of warp-lightning, the Emperor, Iskandar, and their respective honor guards arrived upon the world. Crowds numbering in the millions and hundreds of officials awaited the leader of this mysterious Terran force. They were near blinded by what arrived. Twin gods and an army of Angels descended onto the world. Of the spectators, some fainted, others knelt unconsciously, and many just simply stared, transfixed by the Master of Mankind and his third-born Son.</p><p>The golden Custodes and the regal Astartes stood against the almost garish display of colors the locals coated themselves in which seemed to wilt in comparison to the Emperor and Iskandar. The God-Caller and Called-God approached the most opulently dressed gaggle of officials. Plucking the leader&apos;s name from his mind, the Emperor addressed her. &quot;Conclave Councilwomen Jommexirrs, I am the Emperor of Mankind. I have come from Terra to unify the Human species under one banner. Will this world join us like so many others, to help end the Old Night?&quot;</p><p>The councilwomen fell to her knees and could bare looking at him as she asked her question in a halting voice. &quot;Are you a god? Did the Many-Colored King send you?&quot;</p><p>The Many-Colored King was the god-head the system&apos;s culture worshipped. A figure of wonder, horror, wisdom, and foolishness that in their myths protected them from the worst of Old Night. Smiling softly, the Emperor responded and the old chairwomen could see the weight of eons in his eyes as he did. &quot;No child, I am not a god. Just a human who hopes to protect all of mankind. I was created to guide mankind to its ascension, much like how a parent guides a child to adulthood. No king, god, or other being sent for me. I am here because Mankind wills it.&quot;</p><p>The mystery and wonder of the Emperor&apos;s arrival soon evolved into a festival. Word spread like wildfire. How the golden king of Terra had arrived and with him came promises of a new dawn. Inside the government complex, the Imperium and this new culture met each other. Komorokh was just one of 52 human-inhabited systems within the Cluster. A conclave of allied worlds that traded and provided a mutual defense. Extravagant and eclectic, but not excessive. The Cluster held a culture of pageantry, tradition and bombastic displays. Interestingly, the social fabric of all of these systems was tied together by the worship of the Many-Colored King. He was the object of worship of a singular religion that unified and forged common ground between the systems which were at best many months of warp-hops away from each other.</p><p>The leadership of Komorokh was highly receptive to the idea of joining the Imperium, for the Centauri Conclave worked on the same basic principle of survival through unity. Was it not simply the best option to become part of a larger and more stable whole? Komorokhs place as one of the edge-systems of the Cluster also played a part. Invasions of Xeno, mutants, and worse were rare but not unheard of. Edge systems like Komorokh were where those vicious wars were fought and left lasting scars upon its people and their memories. Being under Imperial protection would save billions. The Imperium offered safety, technology, culture, and a brighter future.</p><p>Only two things made Conclave Councilwomen Jommexirrs and her colleagues hesitate. How the other members of the Conclave would react, and the Imperiums desire to dismantle religion. The first worried them on a practical level. If they alone changed sides they would find themselves a battleground between the Conclave and Imperium. Jommexirr personally had no doubt the Imperium would crush the other 51 systems, but at what cost to her people? Giving up the faith in the Many-Colored King would be extremely difficult as well. For the billions that lived within the Centauri Cluster, he was a figure to be revered and feared. Turning their back on the god would be betraying his protection and spell doom.</p><p>The leaders of Komorokh found themselves slowly but surely drawn to the Imperial Truth. Secret truths were revealed by the Emperor. Chaos, corruption spreading through religion and the Xeno threats infesting the galaxy. Councilwomen Jommexirr found herself increasingly unsettled as the illumination continued. She knew the Many-Colored King was real, she had seen his Angels upon the Cardinal-World. A shiver ran down her spine at the memory. Astartes could be at least passingly angelic, the King&apos;s children could not.</p><p>An agreement was soon reached. Peaceful incorporation of the Cluster would only be possible with the approval of Proxima, the Cardinal-System where the Many-Colored King revealed himself and the heart of his worship. Getting Proxima to join the Imperium and give up its faith would make the rest fall in line. Couriers frantically raced messages between worlds as the details were sorted. The Proxima officials were nervous at the idea of an entire Warfleet arriving in their system. As such the vast majority of the Crusader Fleets would stay in Komorokh and continue advocating the Imperial Truth. A diplomatic mission consisting of Emperor, Primarch and their inner circle would journey to Proxima and convince the Cardinal World.</p><p>As the Emperor and his elite left Komorokh, the Councilwoman felt the golden warmth of the Emperor&apos;s existence fading with distance. She had been lucky her world had felt that light as an illuminating brilliance, a sort of spiritual sunlight to heal the soul. In her brief encounter with the Emperor, Jommexirr&apos;s finely honed instincts let her into the truth of the Emperor. Like a star, he could bring life or death. Komorokh had been graced with his compassion and wisdom. How many systems had and would be cursed with his world-ending wrath? As the Custodes&apos; frigate carrying the diplomatic party entered the Warp, she whispered to herself a truth so obvious most can never see it. &quot;If the Emperor is not a god, then nothing is.&quot;</p><p>The Master of Mankind guided the frigate through the Warp to Proxima, all the while preparing himself and his followers for what might come. The Centauri Conclave was a semi-functioning theocratic federation of human worlds under the protection of an enigmatic god-figure and guarded by mysterious &apos;angels&apos; that disturbed any who encountered them. It was also a fully unique product of the timeline changes. An example of the billions of lives and entire cultures altered in unforeseen ways. It was because of this shifted nature that the Emperor&apos;s foresight was crippled. Peering into both the Warp and gifted memories, Atham the Revelation knew something of great value lay upon Proxima, and a grave threat also awaited him. The details were obscured, muddled by shifting timelines and dueling gods.</p><p>Constine Valdor and Iskandar Basilius took this knowledge and prepared. Spending the days of warp travel training and preparing for any eventuality. Both were experts in security, diplomacy and human culture and they naturally disliked each other intensely. Valdor did little more than acknowledge most of the Primarchs, holding a deep-seated distrust and antipathy for them. They were simply valuable pieces in the Emperor&apos;s ambition. This was fueled by the Captain-Generals knowledge of the God-Emperors timeline. For a creature like Valdor, built for a singular purpose, having a population of powerful beings that could and in some ways already had ruin that purpose exist was antithetical. Where Malcador and the Emperor could see the Primarchs as more than their broken counterparts, Valdor saw them they as another possible and highly insidious threat.</p><p>For his part, Iskandar did little to help heal this relationship. Where most Primarchs understood Valdor&apos;s nature and could have at least functioning relationships with the Custodes. The Imperial Champion felt nothing but bitter rivalry with Valdor. This was based on the nature of the III Legion and the Custodes. The duties of both forces were remarkably similar. A common theme with Iskandar and his sons was a sense of competition with the Golden Brotherhood and constantly sought to prove themselves equal to the 10,000. Iskandar in particular felt this. As the Emperor&apos;s Champion, he knew he must surpass all in his martial skill and loyal service to the Master of Mankind.</p><p>The III Legion and Primarch were made to be the perfect face of the Imperium. Each Battle-Brother sought to craft themselves into a work of art. A thing of perfect duty, following strict codes of honor and etiquette. They held themselves to impossible standards, taking pride in the struggle to master their duties fully. At the Emperor&apos;s side, this drive to excel was pushed even further. They would not be found wanting by their liege.</p><p>When Iskandar was not immersed in his duties, he dwelt within his quarters in deep meditation, focusing upon a curious amulet dangling from his neck. Forged from Terran gold, it glimmered with warm light. Shaped like a disk, it was etched with meticulous microscopic grooves. These grooves were tesseracting patterns containing millenia of records and descriptions. Inscribed into its golden material both physically and psychically, was the human experience. Art, creativity, wonder, emotion, a copy of the human species&apos; collective heart.</p><p>This was Iskandar&apos;s gift: the Singer&apos;s Talisman. A memento carrying tens of thousands of years of human culture into the future. Linked to the Primarch&apos;s soul, he could draw upon its power and wisdom while in turn adding new entries to its codex. All the gifts given to the Primarchs were priceless, yet the Singer&apos;s Talisman stood apart, only matched by Odafin&apos;s Smith&apos;s Talisman, which held a similar record of human innovation in value. According to the Emperor, the gold used in its crafting had once served a similar purpose. It came from a Voyajair cast into the void during mankind&apos;s infancy, and eventually recovered from the hull of an Orkish Space-Hulk nearly fifteen thousand years later.</p><p>Now it rested upon the Primarch&apos;s chest and thrummed with ancient power, matching the twin hearts of the demigod while the Primarch in question inspected the records of the art and culture of the Centauri Conclave in meticulous detail, analyzing it with his transhuman brain and the borrowed wisdom of the Talisman. While human in origin and nature, the encountered culture felt... off. Like it was distorted in some minor but significant way. This was not Chaos, but something else. Almost as if the cluster&apos;s civilization had been shepherded into its current form deliberately. The word that kept coming to Iskandar was &apos;parody&apos;. As if the cluster was an exaggerated version of what was natural. Its religion, government, aesthetic, all distorted in some barely noticeable way.</p><p>Sharing these concerns with the Emperor, father and son prepared for whatever awaited them on Proxima. Psychic beacons were constructed and contingencies planned. If need be the Emperor could summon the Bucephalus at incredible speeds, latching onto the Cognatu Ferrum and pulling its gilded body through the Warp. This brute force method would be effective but could have unpredictable consequences for the vessel and nearby planetary bodies when it entered the Warp. As a further precaution, a spark of psychic power was gifted to both Primarch and Captain-General. Using this spark, they could signal distress in the Astronomicon&apos;s light, alerting the fleet to their needs.</p><p>Exiting the Warp after a scant few days of travel, the Custodes frigate arrived in Proxima. Unlike the grandeur of the Imperial Fleet at Komorokh, this single vessel was barely registered within the bustling cardinal system. Watching great convoys of mass-haulers and pilgrim barges dance between the celestial bodies, the Emperor could not shake the feeling that something was wrong. Proxima held secrets that evaded even his sight.</p><p>Using prearranged Vox codes, the frigate signaled the system. Soon a flight of warships fell in alongside the craft, escorting the Imperial delegation to Proxima. Iskandar entertained himself with intercepted transmissions between the fleets. The Proximan fleet had almost opened fire at their arrival, unable to believe that the kilometer long vessel was a &quot;mere&quot; frigate and not the first arrival of an invasion force. The Proximan escorts were marginally bigger and categorized by them as Grand Cruisers.</p><p>Soon Proxima came into view. To the Emperor&apos;s surprise, it little resembled the planet within his gifted memories. Instead of the greens, browns, and blues common to countless worlds this Proxima was a technicolor masterpiece. Rolling fields of crimson grasses dueled violet canopies, crisscrossed with razor straight lines of obsidian roads interlinking shining cities. Its oceans were a startling blue and flecked with bioluminescent schools of sea life large enough to be seen from orbit.</p><p>The influence affecting the Centauri Cluster went beyond reshaping civilization, it twisted the nature of Proxima as well. The Emperor peered into the Warp, hunting for traces of Chaos. Curiously, the gods attention seemed absent across the system, like something diverted their leering malice away. Warpcraft was not uncommon though. Spiritual flashes and sparks of psykers drawing from the Warp filled the crystal cities, creating an ever shifting pattern in the Warp. The eclectic show distorted foresight and other higher psychic arts making the Emperor muse that this was most likely the reason Chaos Gods ignored the strange system.</p><p>Once in orbit over the Proximan Capital teleportation became possible. Using beamed coordinates the diplomatic party rode a column of warp-lighting into a grand plaza. The city awaiting them was curiously beautiful. Crystal spires weaved together in a heavenward lance. It strangely reminded the Emperor of the rancid Acrologies known as hives. As if the same concept of stacking city upon city had been done in a more natural way.</p><p>The Plaza they arrived in was nearly a kilometer in diameter, enclosed in a glass bubble and burrowed into the spires side. As the blaze of Teleportation faded the chamber was illuminated by the Emperor. His golden light refracted across the chamber, creating a shimmering rainbow that washed over the thousands gathered. All but the strongest wills among the assembled delegates and leaders fell to their knees. The blinding light of Atham the Revelator struck them with awe like so many before.</p><p>Scanning the chamber Iskandar noted the clothes and ornaments favored by Proximan elite. Intricate and flamboyant costumes, each competing with each other. Some had such elaborate outfits they could not kneel properly Leaving the Emperor-shocked dignitaries dangling from their garments as their muscles gave out. Smiling to himself Iskandar felt the filled plaza resembled some crossbreed of avian mating display and flower garden, such was its ridiculousness.</p><p>As the Proximans recovered the Emperor addressed the assembly. His psychic might combining with eloquent words to weave a compelling argument for unity. Iskandar watched the hearts and minds around them slowly but surely bend to the Emperor&apos;s will. The Master of Mankind promised a beautiful future, one where mankind rose above this universes horrors. Where technology, art, culture and commerce could restart. An age where humanity ruled the stars and feared nothing. All the Emperor asked of Proxima was for its people to grow up. Surrender the worship and myths of old. Become what mankind could always be. The Many-Colored King may have protected them and earned their devotion, but it was time to move past such things. Worshipping something just because it is powerful is foolish. Respect your betters protect your lessers. Embrace your humanity and walk the shining path.</p><p>The message cascaded through the officials minds and awoke something in them. A new hope and a surprising sense of trust in this regal arrival. The idea that a speech could have such an effect seems laughable to some. This of course was the world where faith in the Many-Colored King started. Farthest from the clusters edges and the most conservative system. Simple words should have done little to sway the Proximans. What coaxed them into the Emperors light was who the message came from. Nearly 40,000 years of human souls, legends, and history lived within the Emperor. To be in his presence and hear his words is to have the collective will of our species press upon your mind. How can any but the mad, corrupt or truly foolish argue with a Star born of a million million souls?</p><p>Shakely a single Proximan man arose from the kneeling crowd. His robes were woven crystals, forming a plain form that reflected light in countless beautiful ways. They marked him as a High-Priest to the Many-Colored King. The Old Man softly addressed the Emperor: &quot;O&apos;King of Ancient Terra, thy words speak with cruel truths and sweet promises. You ask us to cast aside our faith and god. You offer us a new path forward, but how can we trust you? The Many-Colored King has faced many false-kings and fiends. I challenge you to walk the path of pilgrimage and face his Prophet. Prove to us we need not worship a Many-Colored King but follow a Golden King.&quot;</p><p>The Custodes bristled at the challenge and Valdor reflexively shifted his stance. With a gesture the Emperor ordered them to stand down and approached the elderly High-Priest. The Master of Mankind was eye level with his challenger and towered over him simultaneously. Placing an armored gauntlet of carved gold and light upon the Sages shoulder he plucked knowledge from the Priest and spoke: &quot;High-Priest Stanislav of Proxima, your words are wise and true. Mankind must be careful and strong. I will earn your loyalty and prove the Imperium is the best path to Ascension.&quot;</p><p>At the direction of their hosts, the Imperial party left the grand plaza and started the pilgrimage. The top section of the Spire-City was in fact nearly hollow, a thin layer of institutes encrusted over a gaping hole that held the floating temple of the Many-Colored King. The temple was shaped like a massive human heart of crystal, as its colors constantly shifted due to mirror-gathered light refracted by its strange material. Great strands of gem-muscle were peeled away, forming grisly bridges that connected the Temple and surrounding spire. The pilgrimage into the glass cathedral started with crossing the muscle strand bridges.</p><p>With the Emperor and Iskandar at their head, the Imperials started the journey. The strand-bridges were roughly semi-circular in dimension, the path forming the trough and murals decorating the walls on either side. The inscriptions flowed together, forming a story told with each step forward. A story of how Proxima suffered when Mankind fought its children of metal, who were only finally defeated as Warp-Speakers were born along with the fourth Hell-Monarch. Proxima suffered as Old Night descended and the colors of life faded. All was lost and the world begged for salvation. That salvation came in the form of the Kaleidoscope Nights, when the Many-Colored King sent his Angels and spirits to return the color and protect Proxima. They taught secrets of Warp-Craft, culture and beauty, saving the people from darkness and elevating a prophet with divine wisdom. The Many-Colored King demanded worship and tribute to his Angels in order to protect Proxima. His prophet and spectral servants conveying his will in his absence.</p><p>It felt eerily similar to the Imperium of the 41st Millenium to the Emperor, a culture of worship and tribute in exchange for protection, keeping humans docile and weak so they were happy to serve whomever ever had the biggest gun. This entire system, no, the entire star cluster was some twisted parody of that possible future. The psychic power coursing through the spire distorted the Emperor&apos;s sight, making his mind, foresight and upper senses hazy. A weapon designed to interfere with Gods muddled his perception. That fact worried the Master of Mankind on many levels.</p><p>The bridge soon melted into the Temple, leaving a cut in its side for them to enter. A great drum echoed from within, a solemn beat mimicking the human heart. Entering the temple, the beat grew louder and louder, forcing the transhuman warriors to protect their ears and stabilize against vibrational damage. Matching where an atrium would lie in a human body, the chamber was filled with hundreds of worshipping monks, each looked sick and bent in someway. Dried blood covered the ears of some and a few might have even been corpses, crushed to death under the heartbeat that resonated around them.</p><p>All the monks sat bowed at the chambers far end, where they could watch the rippling energy of the titanic heartbeats originate. Curved inward slightly, the far wall formed an alter of sorts, where the mighty pulse ripped out from the wall&apos;s center. Incense and ritual apparatus cluttered the space around the altar, and half a dozen elderly priests kneeled before it, raw faith keeping their bodies functioning. The mighty footfalls of several hundred power-armored giants went unnoticed as the Imperial approached the altar. Great statues of stone and glass dotted alcoves around the room, all in poses of supplication facing the altar. The chambers walls curved inward and up, forming a tapered peak capping the chamber which pulsed with the heartbeat. Custodes and Astartes took positions as Father and son moved to the Altar.</p><p>A massive mural was carved into the chamber wall. Runes of power and circuits of psychic energy etched into glowing crystal. All originating from the same place of the heart-beat. A small hermit-hole was carved into the gem-flesh, barely large enough to fit a small human it held a curious statue. Inside, a diminutive figure was connected to the temple by glowing tubes, coursing with power. This was the temples focus, plugged into the psychic-structure and worshipped by billions. The Many-Colored King&apos;s Prophet. Ornately carved with ritual garments, a thick layer of dust lay on the statue.</p><p>The statue twitched and clumps of dust fell to the floor. It twitched again, convulsing as it struggled to move. Atrophied muscle forced itself to work and deathly lean arms rose up and fumbled with its head dress. The prophet was no relic or statue, it was a human. Muscle spasms disturbed dust from long dorment flesh. Milky-white eyes flickered open and peered blindly. The Prophet was a little girl, fused into the temple for centuries and living a waking dream of prayer and meditation.</p><p>This was abhorrent. She was an innocent bound and broken, mutilated by forces outside her understanding into a psychic tool. She had been locked away from life and time as an object of worship and preserved by arcane technology. All things bitterly familiar to the Emperor. In a voice cracked by ages, the prophet whispered a question: &quot;Are you the Golden One?&quot;</p><p>The Emperor came to one knee and reached out to the girl, his form shifting from armored giant to robed sage. Meeting her blind eyes, he softly and gently answered: &quot;I am my child, why are you here little one?&quot;</p><p>Cocking her head slightly she observed the brilliant psychic aura of the Emperor. He was just like the Many-Colored King had described. At last, her sacred duty would be at an end. Forcing her dessicated vocal cords to work, she answered the Master of Mankind: &quot;My god tasked me with delivering a message and a gift. The message is &quot;The difference between gods and daemons largely depends upon where one is standing at the time&quot;. The gift he gives you is a word.&quot;</p><p>In that moment, the psychic pulse echoed louder from the prophet, rippling through the crystal heart and illuminating a mural hidden at the back of her alcove. The mural was of a laughing face, half black, half white, surrounded by a spiders web. A sigil ancient beyond measure, left as a calling card by the Many-Colored King. It was a final punchline to reveal his identity to the Emperor. Cegorach, the Laughing God was at work across Proxima.</p><p>Dawning horror filled the Emperor as the child prophet opened her mouth, stretching it in ways not meant for human flesh to be moved. Vocal cords and facial muscles were flooded with arcane power as the Heart-Temple fulfilled its purpose in preserving and preparing the prophet, allowing her to give the Emperor of Mankind a gift. In a voice that defied the material universe, the Prophet of Proxima spoke the tongue of the Old Ones. She proclaimed a terrible command, and the universe obeyed.</p><p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>&quot;DEATH&quot;</em></span></p><p>Enuncia is the first language. Once, it was like any other, a method of conveying meaning between beings and spoken by the first sentients to touch the Warp. As these first-born dived into the Sea of Souls and mastered it, they encountered the Wellspring, the place where everything and anything originates from. Secrets were uncovered and the first attempt to master the Immaterium occured. Drinking from the Well of Eternity, the Old Ones gained a power beyond comprehension. They gained the power to impose their will on the cosmos, to dominate and enforce their sanity and will upon the sea of souls.</p><p>Whereas their successors anointed singular beings to master and bridge the surface and deeps, the Old Ones bound the power of God-Calling to their language. Enuncia is the Old Ones God-Caller and the very first instance of the Anathema. It was a language that can overwrite reality. A word spoken in it becomes real and powerful beyond compare. Those with the strength and knowledge can wield it, but at a terrible price. Every use was dangerous to the user, for it called upon the universe itself and forcing it to change. The more powerful and complex the order, the greater the price. The Old Ones would burn out entire bodies and lifespans singing songs of creation and destruction to alter existence.</p><p>Cegorach had turned a human child into his prophet and weapon, teaching her a single word of Enuncia. He taught her the most powerful and feared single utterance in the God-Language, the word for Death/End/Doom/Extinction/Erase/Delete. The prophet should not have survived such knowledge, her body and mind crushed under the universes mechanisms. This was the purpose of this temple and religion; to keep the prophet alive and working, containing that Word until she could play her part.</p><p>The Emperor of Mankind moved at speeds that defied physics and reason, arcane knowledge and incalculable warp power racing against what was about to occur. For all his ability and skill, it was not enough. The moment the Prophet&apos;s mouth spat forth that impossible word, death struck. Enuncia speaks to the universe, and the universe answers. The Prophet said the Emperor was dead, and the cosmos rewrote itself to signify that truth. Existence itself started to shift, erasing the Master of Mankind.</p><p>Atham felt it, a great swell of space/time. His very molecules started to fade, individual atoms melting into nothingness. When he was born, the Emperor had been etched into the Warp. His very existence burned into the universe. Those long dead Shamans and their immaterial allies had touched the Well of Eternity and embedded its power into mankind, birthing a God-Caller who could call upon the power of both realms enforce mankind&apos;s sanity upon both. The body born in ancient Anatolia held this power and guided humanity. Now that vessel of flesh and light was being destroyed.</p><p>Horror filled Iskandar as he watched chunks of his father&apos;s flesh and armor dissolve into the void. Both Primarch and Captain General charged to protect the Emperor. Iskandar was faster and reached out to seize the rapidly dissolving Anathema. One moment his arm was coated in byzintine purple armor and touching the Emperor&apos;s shoulder, the next it was gone. Iskandar screamed in horror as a bloody stump nearly reaching his shoulder appeared. Nearly half the Emperor&apos;s body and Iskandar&apos;s arm was gone, leaving gaping wounds that grew with each second. Frantically the Emperor swung his remaining hand and with a wave of telekinetic force pushed his son and his bodyguard away, protecting them both from doom.</p><p>Grasping at air and flickering with warpfire, the Emperor looked into Iskandar&apos;s eyes. The Emperor had been fast enough, his son had only lost an arm. Desperately, he conveyed what might be his last piece of wisdom before he vanished. &quot;Iskandar, my son, you are not a Serpent. You are a phoenix. A phoenix, Iskandar! Rise, rise from the ashes!&quot;</p><p>With those frantic words, a blast of golden light erupted from the Emperor&apos;s wounds. The Master of Mankind was fighting for his life. Cegorach had caught him by surprise and used an impossible weapon. Why the damnable clown-god would do this would be discovered. For now, Atham simply struggled to survive. Golden power encircled his flesh and halted the advancing erasure. Such a curse could ruin the Emperor&apos;s flesh, but not his soul or mind. Such a thing was powerful beyond reason, branded into the universe just as Enuncia was. The Emperor could survive without a body, but such a fate would be worse than death. Unanchored in the Materium, he could become something far greater and more terrible.</p><p>Such a fate would not stand. The Emperor carried a million years of human history. He would not allow himself to become like the God-Emperor or worse. Eununcia was a form of God-Calling, gone diluted and feral without its original masters. The Emperor was not hampered by such things. The full might of humanity was his. With herculean effort, the Emperor pushed against the tide of restructuring reality. Space/time itself worked to erase his body, but such petty things would not stop him. With enormous willpower, Atham the Revelation fought for each individual molecule, enforcing his will on the universe itself and keeping atomic bonds together through sheer strength.</p><p>As the Emperor struggled to preserve and rebuild his flesh, the temple around the Imperial party cracked. Iskandar frantically looked around, watching the crystal heart shatter before them. A black burn mark covering the Altar wall was all that remained of the Prophet. Her body and soul were reduced to nothing, leaving a stain that perfectly formed the sigil of Cegorach. The monks had also been killed, bodies simply ceasing to function as the Enuncian curse started. A thing of such total death was too much for an unaugmented human mind and body. Even when not focused on them, the shockwaves snuffed the life from the monks. Astartes and Custodes are made of sterner stuff. It rattled, but not hurt Mankind&apos;s defenders.</p><p>The Primarch centered himself and closed his wound, biomancy squeezing arteries shut and dulling his screaming nerves. Disoriented and scared, Iskandar unsheathed his sword and collected himself. Valdor was ahead of him, quickly giving commands to the Companions. A squad of Custodes lifted the Emperor&apos;s body between them on a litter of shields. They would escape this world and return to the Bucephalus. There, the Emperor could heal.</p><p>Valdor shouted orders and Voxed the frigate to teleport them offworld, but the psychic interference was too great. The temple&apos;s collapse and the Emperor&apos;s struggles thrashed through the Warp and made it to where another method into orbit was required. Iskandar sent some of his sons to scout ahead, clearing the path for the Custodes. A slight motion caught the Primarchs eye and he spun face it, blade in remaining hand. One of the monks had stood up, a sharp hunk of fractured crystal grasped in its hand. Faster than any human should be able to move, the monk lept at Iskandar moving with inhuman grace and poise. Atom-sharp adamantium cleaved the monk&apos;s head from his shoulders. Iskandar had lashed out with his uru-blade. Crippled and shaken, he was still the greatest duelist the Imperium possessed.</p><p>Before any questions could be asked, other monks rose, their motions like that of marionettes being pulled on their strings. They were dead, that was certain. No life or soul filled them, only warp-craft. Dead flesh and bone tore itself apart as the monks attacked the Imperials with flexibility and power beyond the basic human form. Astartes and Custodes parried the dancing corpses and quickly hacked them to pieces, watching as the bodies danced the dance of death, even as it tore them apart. Some alien force puppetered them to fight in ways impossible to mankind.</p><p>Just as the last monk fell to a Guardian Spear strike, the next part of the performance started. A puppet show was starting and its puppeteers had finished warming up. Iridescent light ignited within the Temple statues. The hidden guardians alcoves came to life and showed their nature. These were Aeldari Soul-Dolls, Wraithbone constructs animated by the scraps of souls.</p><p>The Laughing God once had thousands of cults in his name, each worshiping in serving in their own unique ways. Those who survived the fall tucked away in the Black Library had been reborn as the Harlequins. Yet only a fragment of Cegorach&apos;s followers are known to the galaxy at large. Only some of his chosen traveled with his troupes. Others plied more secret or hidden crafts. One of these performer priesthoods is the Maerion-Tur: Cegorach&apos;s Puppet Masters. They were powerful psykers who could fracture their soul and consciousness into dozens, or even hundreds of pieces, allowing for control and perfect coordination of small armies of Soul-Dolls.</p><p>Now, these elusive children of Cegorach performed for Mankind&apos;s Anathema. Dozens of Soul-Dolls, each matching an Aspect Warrior in talent attacked. Custodes threw themselves between the homunculin tools and their master. Adamantium blades clashing with Wraithbone claws. Annoyance lanced through Iskandar, they did not have time for such things. His father suffered to protect him. These filthy Xenos would pay, but for now they had to get into orbit. Focusing his mind and body, Iskandar went to war.</p><p>Superhuman muscles pushing into overdrive, the Primarch leapt at the nearest Soul-Doll. His Uru-Blade got to work, its form shifting from whip, rapier, and saber as needed. The Primarch&apos;s weapon was a thing of genius. Memory alloys, Adamantium, and archeotech weaved together into a shape-changing blade. Its length, rigidity, and shape were subject to its wielder&apos;s skill, only limited by its size and wielders imagination. Even the most skilled Astartes would find such a weapon daunting in its complexity. Iskandar used it as an extension of his flesh.</p><p>Storms of razor-metal tore through the Soul-Doll. Before it&apos;s lacerations fully opened, Iskandar had moved to the next, and then the next. A trail of sonic-booms followed the Primarchs as he accelerated around the chamber, cutting through all fifty two Soul-Dolls in the time it took the shards from the first struck to hit the floor. In that moment of incredible violence, a flicker of surprise crossed Valdor&apos;s face as he realized what had happened. This is what a Primarch is capable of.</p><p>Exiting the Temple, the Imperials looked like a heavily armed funeral procession. Hundreds of warriors crossed the crystal bridge with the Emperor born upon his companion&apos;s shields. Such a resemblance crossed Iskandar&apos;s mind and was quickly thrown away, fear had no place in his heart now. Small packs of flesh-puppets crossed from the bridge. Composed of fallen priests and wraithbone puppets. they sought to attack the Imperials. Primarch and Honor Guard led the procession and tore through all in their way, racing the collapsing temple as massive sheets of crystal fell off its deteriorating bulk. Hundreds fell to the fury of the pursuing horde as they butchered through the outer temple and into the city proper.</p><p>Bursting free into the open air, they were greeted with a massive flash of light and sound. The Imperial Frigate had exploded in orbit, reduced to ash and scrap raining across the sky. The Emperor and his guards were stranded. As this knowledge was digested and before a new plan could be formulated, two events occurred. First, dozens of shimmering Aeldari craft flickered into being around the spire. Holofields faded as the gaudily painted ships flitted around like birds of prey. Iskandar could sense the alien intelligences within each, watching him with perfidious mirth. The second event was a great roar, like the ignition of some far off engine. Growing louder with each second, it soon became clear what the origin was.</p><p>The Enuncian aftershocks had echoed from the temple and across Proxima. The entire hive had died and rose again. A billion puppeteered corpses stampeded towards them, guided by the Laughing God&apos;s servants. The Show had just begun.</p><p>The Aeldari ships opened fire, their monomolecular killing edges flying around the Imperials. Even beings as touch as transhumans could not withstand sustained gunship fire. They would be butchered if they did not move away from this place and quickly. Hurriedly, the five elite Librarians within the Primarch&apos;s honor guard erected a kineshield around the party, borrowing mental strength from their brothers to block the wave of crystal munitions. Gritting his teeth with anger, Iskandar mustered his own psychic power. A spear of warp flame erupted from his remaining hand and flew at the xenos gunships. It exploded into a wave of fire that resembled a crudely shaped avian, its heat and psychic power jostling the Aeldari while denying them a clear shot</p><p>Flanked by stormshield carrying Astartes and Custodes, the Imperial force moved at speeds mortal eyes could barely track. While numbering slightly over two hundred and fifty, the Imperials were still able to move with supernatural precision and cohesion. They darted between cover and kill zones, all of them putting flesh and steel between the Emperor and their enemies. Iskandar fired half a dozen more of his fire bolts before they reached their destination.</p><p>The spherical plaza they had arrived in would be their stronghold. Its crystalline structure was deceptively strong. That, along with its four securable gates and proximity attracted the Imperials. Pushing past its gates, they were greeted with the stench of recent death. Thousands of fallen Proximans filled the kilometer sized bubble of glass. Every single one of them was puppetered with Xenos warp craft. Armed only with meat and bone, the nobility which had so eagerly greeted the Emperor attacked the Imperial party. With disdainful ease, the Astartes and Custodes butchered them but were careful to not blunt their weapons or spend ammunition on this distraction.</p><p>The Aeldari ships floated around the plaza, occasionally testing the Imperials sanctuary with spats of weapon fire. Designed to protect against orbital dangers both natural and artificial the Crystal sphere held strong. Iskandar could not understand why the Xenos did not use more powerful weapon? He was not arrogant enough to assume the Aeldari lacked weapons of that power. What he did not understand was the severity of the Aeldari Fall. It made mankind&apos;s suffering during the Old Night seem a minor cultural setback. The vessels that floated around the sphere were not gunboats deployed as part of a fleet. They were jury-rigged pleasure craft hastaly salvaged for this mission by Cegorach&apos;s servants.</p><p>The III Legion Astartes sent ahead had cleared most of the surrounding Soul-Puppets, both flesh and wraithbone. The Hive-around the Plaza resembled a park and was sparsely inhabited. Being easily cleared of the false-dead. The bodies were burned with fire both natural and warp-based. The Primarch hated giving these poor fallen mortals rest by burning pit, but time was of the essence. The rest of the hive scrabbled towards them in a tide of puppetered flesh.</p><p>Helix shaped paths wound around the Hive spire. Beautifully crafted roads that guided traffic like a river current. Now those streets and tram ways were packed with an unliving tsunami. Every man women, and child of Proxima had been turned into a golem by Cegorach&apos;s puppeteers. Soon they would make it through the natural barriers and obstacles built into the hives structure and enter the upper-hives palatial district the Imperials hide within.</p><p>The Massive gates to the Plaza-sphere were shut with Astartes muscle and welded shut with psychic fire. All except one. The central gate would be were the Imperial forces made a stand. Iskandar and his Librarians had noticed a subtle difference between the puppets made of human flesh and the ones made of alien crystal. The Crystal ones were intelligent and powerful, carrying a fragment of the puppeteers soul within them. By contrast the flesh ones were simply injected with a bit of warp-energy to light up their lizard-brain and instill a basic command.</p><p>The enemy far, far, far outnumbered them but the vast majority of that force was mindless. Leaving one gate open gave a path of least resistance for the puppets to attack. Where the combined might of a Primarch, the Legio Custodes and Legio Astartes could hold their ground. Any crystal dolls or Aeldari warriors would lack the power to puncture the crystal sphere. Forcing them to fight among the unliving hoard, hampering the natural agility of the Xenobreed.</p><p>Soon the constant deafening roar of a billion corpses screaming eternally was matched by a thunder of footsteps. The Flesh-puppets would soon be upon them. Of the Imperials only two figures did not ready themselves for the defense. The Emperor of Mankind and his firstborn Custodes. The Master of Mankind was radiant, steeped in ancient power even as he lay half dead. Valdor kneeled beside his fallen creators comatose body and not moved. Nearly a third of the Emperors flesh was gone. Stretching from his left arm to his left eye and down to gut level. Where one would expect blood and gore a stream of light instead poured from the wound. Like sunlight pouring through a cracked plaster. Constantin Valdor grimly thought that the analogy was accurate. Muscle and bone that holding the Emperor&apos;s star like power had been split open. He could sense his creator struggling to seal himself shut and not burn everything.</p><p>Valdor knelt by the Emperor and reached into his Soul. He was no psyker, none of his kind were. That part of the human soul had been&#x2026; altered in him. Still, knowledge of what he had to do came quickly. The Emperor had inserted a beacon inside his very being. Now was time to unleash it. As the first wave of Aeldari flesh-puppets came into view Constantin Valdor sent for help. A blast of golden light ripped forth from the Custodian. Shining in the Warp it seemed for a single moment the Astronomicon had a pale reflection. Bright but short lasting the signal burned itself out and left the Captain-General exhausted. It did not go unnoticed.</p><p>Across the void, in orbit of Komorokh the Bucephalus slumbered. Its arcane engines rumbling and its crew busy with matters of compliance. The intelligence that dwelt within the Master of Mankind&apos;s steed was, for lack of a better word, bored. Away from the frontlines of the Crusade and centers of Imperial power, the Cognatu Ferrum lacked in tasks. It had calculated and recalculated the logistic needs of Crusader Fleet Zero at first. Then started analyzing the vessels of both the Centauri Cluster fleets and Third Legion. Once it learned all it could the Cognatu Ferrum started drawing up battleplans against this Centauri Cluster.</p><p>This mental exercise would become disturbingly useful when a light flashed across the Warp. Picked up by the Bucphalus&apos;s collection of sensors and quickly fed to the Cognatu Ferrum. In the pillar of psychic fire was an arcane message. Encoded with a traditional Custodes cipher it proved quick work of the Cognatu Ferrum to understand. Its content was simple and sent a wave of shock through the Psychic intelligences circuits. &quot;Proxima is a Trap. Aeldari Laughing God Puppets. The Throne is Empty.&quot;<br>&quot;The Throne is Empty&quot; A code phrase known to only the Custodians, Primarchs and a scant few trusted by the Emperor. It meant the Master of Mankind is incapactiated and possibly severely wounded. While little more than a psychic echo sculpted into a machine the Cognatu Ferrum felt panicked dread. Its existed solely to serve the Emperor. The Psi-Intellgence would do anything to save its creator. Practically no warning was given to the ships crew and surrounding Imperial fleet as the Buchphalus thundered towards the nearest Mandeville Point. Emergency broadcasts echoed from the vessels vox as it informed the rest of the Imperial fleet of its destination and the ambush underway. Quickly the Custodes and Astartes commanders divided their forces. Three quarters would head to Proxima, the rest would guard Komorokh and the other systems at the Centuari Cluster&apos;s edge. Nothing without an Aquilla mark would make it in or out of the star-cluster.</p><p>Back upon Proxima, Iskandar stood at the gate. Custodes and Astartes formed a living wall of adamantium and transhuman flesh. The message had been sent, now all they had to do was survive until it was answered. That was far easier said than done. An oceanswell of corpses rampaged across the palatial district towards them. A slight bridge and the plaza&apos;s gate would be the thin, firm line they had to hold. Organized under multiple layers of defense the Imperials would do anything to prevent the enemy from reaching the Emperor.<br>Terminators both Astartes and Custodes would hold the first line. They could not stop the coming horde but instead sought to break them. From a solid mass of corpses to tendrils of puppet-flesh more easily hacked to pieces. The Imperials braced with shield, axe, sword, spear and fist. Ragged corpses stretching as far as the eye could see screamed, their echoes ringing with the hideous false life they were infused with. Many of the puppets had already collapsed under the stress of the warp craft pushing them to their physical breaking point. Still, they were carried forward by sheer inertia.</p><p>Right as the tide was about to hit, Iskandar gestured forward, channeling psychic power from his remaining hand, creating a telekinetic wave that crashed into the tide. Like throwing a boulder into a tidal wave, it made a splash, scattering some corpse while burying others under their coming replacements. The attack was utterly futile at stopping the wave but that was not the purpose. Iskandar was skilled in the use of psychic power as a sensory tool. It was a probe, searching for how the enemy might be controlled.<br>Warp energy had been infused into the corpses on an integral level. Not easy to disrupt, but lacking in adaptability. This was not universally the case, some of puppets had &apos;strings&apos; of psychic energy guiding them. Iskandar guessed that they were the alpha marionettes who were connected to Cegorach&apos;s servants and acted as conduits for commands and control over the lesser puppets. These were what needed to die. Cutting the strings might not break the spell, but it would reduce these poor wretches animated by xenos magik to droll autotomons unable to do anything beyond a single command.</p><p>The first wave smashed into the Terminator clad astartes, minced to paste by Adamantium armor and the sheer pressure of the second and third impact. Almost instantly, the Third Legion soldiers were inundated with sheer walls of bodies, ramping up and over the transhumans like a storm over a breakwall. The Terminators fought on, even as they were completely submerged beneath the bodies of their foes. Mere muscle, bone and what ever crude tools scavenged by the Aeldari puppets couldn&apos;t hope to scratch the paint on their armor. Each and every one of the astartes swung his weapon wildly. Relying on the sheer mass of the mech-suit and power-weapons to kill. Even buried under the tide of mindless flesh, the occasional crack of a Thunder Hammer or Power Fist could still be heard, always accompanied by an explosion of viscera as the impact detonated upon a swarm of corpses.</p><p>Shortly behind the Terminators were the Blade Companions and Sword Masters of the legion. These paragons of blade art became whirling masses of death, destroying scores of corpses with every single thrust and swing. Their efforts created a dancing column of blades that tore through the tide. Lastly, in a great ring around the gate, was a solid line of Astartes and Companions forming an impregnable wall. Their role was to herd the puppets back into the grinder and butchering those who somehow made their way through the armor and blades. Librarians and Sagittarum Guard worked hard to clear away the ever increasing mass of corpses.</p><p>In the center of this melee was the Primarch and his inner circle of warriors. The Talons of the Primarch, as they called themselves. A tribute to the Emperor&apos;s own elite. These warriors were handpicked and trained by Iskandar himself, trusted to not only fight by his side but also not slow him down. They had a special task: cutting the puppets&apos; threads. They weaved through the battle and destroying the flesh puppets imbued with a strand of xeno-sorcery, taking noble satisfaction at every corpse denied a modicum of intelligence and strategy. Missing an arm and mentally exhausted, the Primarch fought like a force of nature. His Uru Blade spun around him in the form of bladed whip, reducing any enemy to enter its reach to ribbons. Rarely a crystalline golem of wraith-bone would appear in the tide. Hiding in the corpse-tide and observing Imperial defenses. Iskandar took great pleasure in destroying them.</p><p>The Imperial forces fought for days without rest, even as the plaza&apos;s exterior was covered in a layer of crawling corpses. A veritable carpet of scrabbling bodies clambering upon each other, and whatever handholds they could find purchase. All sought to reach the gate, which increasingly resembled a waterfall of bodies pouring from every direction into the plaza. The gold and purple of the defenders was hidden behind coats of burnt gore and dried blood. Custodes and Astartes practically indistinguishable such was the mess of ichor covering them. The enemy was individually weak, but almost innumerable in quantity. These flesh puppets tired the warriors of the Imperium not through skill or intensity, but by sheer numbers. The sun set and rose again as they fought on. The Librarians taking turns channeling warp-flames to burn away the corpses. Leaving the Plaza covered in a film of greasy ash. Only one space was clean of the filth. A rough oval around the Master of Mankind. Whose golden light burned away even the wretched stain.<br>The battle raged on and the Imperiums warriors held strong. Facing down an enemy a billion strong is an impossible feat. Yet with a Primarch his sons and the Emperor&apos;s own custodians it was seeming somehow within reach. For five whole days the Transhumans hacked and smashed through the horde. Rotating from the front lines to rest and requip only when their weapons were pushed to the brink.</p><p>Allarus Custodian Doukas Meroving was nearing the end of one of these shifts. The fierce Custodes had spent eighteen hours as part of the battle line. Hacking away at the never-ending flood of flesh-puppets. Pure scornful hate filled him as he swung his power axe through the dancing corpses. The imperials had stopped using the power-fields on their weapons days ago. The nearly unblemishable killing edge of Terran metal serving its purpose. No need for extra wear caused by the disruptive energy current. Doukas was a third generation Custodes. Born during the Unification Wars final days. Serving the Emperor ever since. His body and mind could operate in a warzone for days or even weeks without proper rest. Yet that was not what he was doing. This was plain butchery. Trying to stop a river with sheer force. It wore on his armor, his weapons, and even on him.</p><p>That slight wear on him, not enough for any but a fellow transhuman to notice provided a chink in his armor. A slight opening imperceptible to even him. So when an atom-sharp blade of Xeno-make slipped past his guard, and into his throat. Without him even noticing. Doukas died confused and bewildered. Choking on his own blood. Out of the tide of corpses, a phantom slithered. Cloaked in shimmering crystal and bedecked with motley armor. The phantom stared up at the dying custodes, with an ivory mask. Clutching the elegant blade in its hands, the Xeno whispered in its exotic tongue &quot;Mael dannan&quot; and parted Doukas&apos;s head from his shoulders.</p><p>Warning runes flashed across the Imperial Defenders helmet display. Informing them of Custodian Doukas&apos;s death. Then barely giving any warning of what came next. Like ancient predators of terran jungles, figures exploded out of the sea of corpses. Dancing between the transhuman defenders and rushing towards the Emperor. Thirteen Aeldari warriors moved at impossible speeds. All wore identical masks. Ivory faces of androgenous perfection, marred by daemonic horns and shrouded by a deep cowl. These were the Arebennian, Avatars of She who Thirsts. Known across the galaxy by an ironic nickname born of their isolation and uncertain fate. The Solitaire of Cegorach.</p><p>Bitter fury burned in Iskandar&apos;s heart as he saw the Xeno assassins. Easily matching them in speed the Primarch intercepted the Harlequin. His adonais face contorted in a rictus of fury. Roaring a challenge in his Assa-Matrari dialect of gothic: &quot;On ne passe pas!&quot; These hollow-soul clowns would die by his hand. Swinging his Uru-Blade down upon a Solitaries sword with god-like force. Iskandar felt the Xeno&apos;s crystal bones crack, it could stop his blow but not the transhuman power behind it. Gesturing with his stump he summoned a wave of force that smashed the Solitaire back into the corpse tide. The puppets jumped to cushion the impact with their rotten flesh. The Maerion-Tur puppet-masters were playing their part, using the corpse-puppets as armor and weapons for the Solitaries.<br>Leaping forward the Primarch faced down six of the Solitaries by himself. His Uru-Blade shifting between sword and whip in each moment. Bringing a cascade of strikes the Solitaries struggled to deflect or dodge. These motley clad warrior-priests coursed with psychic power and forbidden knowledge. Each could match a Custodes easily. Iskandar danced between the enemies blades and mono-filaments with disdainful ease. To the Harlequin everything was a performance, even this deadly feat of dueling a Primarch. Moving with a rhythm and elegance simultaneously beautiful and disturbing to human eyes. Iskandar started to barely decipher this Dance without End. Each killing blow he should have made struck an afterimage or flesh-puppets. He was faster and stronger then any Aeldari could ever hope to be. Yet even the Primarch could not find a weakness in a style of combat with sixty million years to perfect itself.</p><p>A talon of the Third Legion strayed from his formation. Pulled by the meticcous blade craft, forced to dodge and parry till outside his brothers sword-reach. Instantly the Xenos congregated. Riding upon waves of corpses, all thirteen Solitaires attacked. One moment they surrounded the Astartes. Next they plunged back into the corpse walls. The Talon collapsed into a pile of severed limbs and splintered metal. Thirteen blades had cleaved him apart faster than he could react. This could not continue, Iskandar would not let his sons and comrades be cut down like this. If the Aeldari wanted to make war into a performance. The Primarch would oblige them.</p><p>Psychic power poured into the Ur-gold medallion dangling from his neck. Iskandar awoke his gift. The Singers Talisman flared to life. Within it was the accumulated beauty and artistry of mankind. Every emotion and sensation ever invoked by creativity left an echo in the Warp. An echo that reverberated in every human soul. Now the Singers talisman harmonized with Iskandar and bled into real space.</p><p>Drumbeats of war and horns of victory blared in each and every Imperials mind. The talents and technique of untold billions converted into visceral power. It brought new crystal focus to the transhumans. Reinvigorating taught muscles and fried nerves. Giving insight into the Solitaires dances and dervishes. Protecting from illusions both psychic and physical. Encapsulating each in rainbow-flames that burned away the puppet-strings on any corpse-doll ordered near them.</p><p>At the center of this was Iskandar, the primarch awash in kaleidoscope energy. The Singers talisman, when awakened with sufficient psychic power, called out into the Warp. Harnessing the untold power of human creativity. Such a force is near unstoppable. Equally wonderful and terrible. Mankind&apos;s most primal imprint upon the sea of souls unleashed. Creating a conduit of wild magik and mystery. It would not be trapped, it would not be contained. Once awoken and set free into the materium it would not be sated with empowering a few souls and extinguishing other. It fell the the Primarch to bar the gates of reality. A living dam to keep the floodwaters at bay and harness the current. In the coming ages mankind would be worthy of this power and its potential. For now the Singers Talisman and the Hammer Talisman must be both kept under guard. Used only at the discretion of the Emperor&apos;s sons.</p><p>Now the Primarch bloomed with this power. Giddy on the majesty of human creativity. Guarding and controlling the Singers Talisman would wear down the Primarch. Damaging his mind, body and soul in ways even he could not heal from. Time could not be wasted. Invoking this power was an act of desperate foolishness. A scared child doing anything he could to save his parents. Still one could not deny its effectiveness. The battle shifted against the Aeldari corpse-puppets and Iskandar Basileus struck.</p><p>First the Primarch exploded forward at a prancing Solitaire. The Xeno was the least of its kin-warriors. Flinching at the corona of tecnicolor energy pouring through the crystal plaza. Breaking the dance without end and sealing its doom. The Uru-Blade shaped into a longsword ripped through the Solitaires skull and spine. Lodging itself in the dying Aeldari as the Primarch released his weapon. Whirling on the spot, Iskandar used his now free hand to grip a jumping Solitaire by the leg. The Xeno had tried to use its comrades death to create an opening. Its motley armor cracked and stained red as Iskandar brought it crashing down. Grinning madly Iskandar ripped his sword from the first dead Eldar and spoke: &quot;Two down, eleven to go&quot;</p><p>The remaining Solitaires leaped forward to dance with the Primarch in a duel of blades, souls, and minds. Eleven Aeldari blades twirled around humanity&apos;s champion, hunting for any weakness. They found none. In fact, Iskandar was winning more and more with every clash of blades. With each parry and thrust, Iskandar was growing faster, stronger. Capable of not only holding his own against nearly a dozen of the Galaxy&apos;s greatest warriors but winning. The rest of the battle continued, psychic powers and spiritual adrenaline pumping through transhuman muscle. The Astartes drank deep of the Talismans essence. Laughing, singing and cheering as they carved through the never-ending tide with newfound vigor. The Custodes, by contrast, were struggling. The warp-song channeled through Iskandar&apos;s talisman wore on their minds. Its wild beauty/horror grinding at the Custodes restructured post-human minds.</p><p>Iskandar was thoroughly intoxicated with power. Laughing madly as he danced with the Harlequin. Roaring ancient Terran battle anthems with pitch-perfect precision. His body was cloaked in a cloud of iridescent smoke. A byproduct of the talisman and its effect on Iskandar&apos;s soul. It followed his every movement and persisted a moment or two after. As the Primarch lept and struck, its trail formed a serpentine tail of kaleidoscope vapor. With his remaining arm and a telekinetic lance formed around his stump the Primarch struck. Blade and psychic energy lashed out at the Eldar which, to their merit, blocked what should have been hundreds of killing blows, relying on their own gifts of physical and psychic skill to duel a demigod.</p><p>It would not be enough for the youngest remaining Harlequin. A prodigy by Aeldari standards, she had kept up with her seniors, surviving even as two fell to the god-prince&apos;s blade. She alone of the Harlequin attackers was born after the Fall. Her mother had hidden away among hundreds of fellow refugees in a webway realm barely a mile wide. As a child, she alone escaped this pocket&apos;s collapse. When She Who Thirsts children came calling, this daughter of the new galaxy had been given a wraithbone dagger and told to run. She ran for what could have been days or weeks, eventually collapsing at the base of a technicolor shrine. The Laughing God&apos;s followers found her there, realizing that she was an example of the new Aeldari, the fractured Eldar. Newborn to a dying species. A spark of light in the Dance Without End. As she clashed with the Primarch, a whip of warp-smoke and telekinesis wrapped around her leg. Pulled from her performance, she died thinking of her mother&apos;s face as the Uru-Blade sunk through armor and flesh.</p><p>This death was of course expected by her god. This was a performance, a tale of the foolish Mon&apos;keigh struggling against an unstoppable tide of darkness. Iskandar had felled three of his children, each playing the role of Slaanesh, but won the duel at great cost. He was forced to rely on increasingly mad and dangerous power, which set the stage perfectly for act two. The death of three Harlequins is not an event to go unnoticed. Somewhere deep in the Warp, the Dark Prince and the Laughing God dueled for three souls, distracting the God of Pleasure just enough to let other prey sneaks by, giving the Harlequin an opportunity to dive into the sea of souls. Teleporting vast distances, in a chaos-defying feat of psychic prowess.</p><p>Just as Iskandar pulled his blade from his kill, the world cracked. A fissure of space/time splitting from the fallen Aeldari body to the sky, ripping straight through the dome and the corpses scrabbling across it. The Primarch jumped back as it widened, alarmed at the new, yawning grin into the Warp. Music of haunting beauty and disoriented volume shook the plaza, blasted forth from the Xeno ships on great vox-equivalents. The sound expanded the new crack in the crystal bubble encasing them. This was the stage cue the Harlequins were waiting for. With a flash of light comparable to an atomic weapon, the Rift exploded and shattered the dome into a billion pieces, releasing a deluge of flesh-puppets. The safety and protection the Imperials had fought to keep were gone in one horrifying instant.</p><p>Then the rest of the play&apos;s performers arrived. Using the Solitaires&apos; death and subsequent warp-rift as a door, the Harlequins arrived in force. Appearing from thin air in a motley detonation of color and light. Hundreds of Aeldari attacked, leaping from the warp-rift in grandiose displays of inhuman acrobatics. Mimes and Death Jesters careened through the air. Wearing the garish grin of Cegorach, the High-Avatar flipped over the head of the human soldiers, decapitating an Astartes and Custodian with a single magnificent stroke. Gas canisters filled with powdered wraithbone and hallucinogens capable of driving planets mad were unleashed. Troubadours attacked the Imperials in perfect synchronicity, forming a whirling maelstrom of holo-fields, shuriken fire, and wraithbone blades.</p><p>Reacting quickly, the Imperials abandoned the kill-box formation they had used with such effectiveness against the Corpse-Puppets. The puppets seemed to be slower and less coordinated. They were no longer an unliving tide, but a shuffling mass of corpses. The Imperials had no way of knowing this, but it was actually their doing. The increased psychic interference from Iskandar and the rift was wreaking havoc. Now the Imperials joined together into sword-squads. To cover each other, and hunker down from the Xeno onslaught. Even as they parried and blocked the Custodes and Astartes moved into a tighter formation around the Emperor&apos;s body. Each sword-squad becoming a living bailey in a shrinking fortress with the Emperor at its center. As the dome had cracked and rained crystal-dust and broken bodies. The Emperor lay undisturbed. His slumber undisturbed, guarded by Valdors blade and will.</p><p>Throughout this, Iskandar fought on, providing the Imperials valuable time to regroup. The Primarch reaved a path of death through the Eldar. Standing alone, drenched in gore and laughing maniacally, an incarnate of Wars madness. The Harlequins danced through the air, leaping from corpse pile to corpse pile. Weaving between Imperial blades and Bolts. Faced with a proper target the Custodes and Astartes had opened fire. They filled the air with exotic energy and diamond-tipped rounds. Every shot that missed pummeled the Corpse-Puppets, turning them into sprays of red mist and bone fragments that added another gory display of pyrotechnics to the battle.</p><p>Imperial transhumans are some of the most deadly warrior-types in the galaxy, fusing the armor and killing power of a tank with the mobility and reactivity of special forces. Few things could withstand an attack by them, or pierce their defense. The children of the Laughing God could be counted among that small number. Exhausted physically and mentally, overdue for armor and weapon maintenance, the Astartes and Custodes were faced with a legitimate threat. The grinning players of Cegorach danced between the human bullets and blows, slashing with force-swords and cruel monofilaments. Though they were cut apart by Xeno weapons the Imperials fought on. Talon Pellon of the III Legion would later become renowned for his incredible feat of impaling two Trouper, one in each of his blades. After one of the perfidious Xenos drove a crystal dagger into his right eye and out the back of his head. It was just one of many acts of heroism the III Legion and Custodes performed in the line of duty.</p><p>Throughout this bloodshed and madness, the Primarch fought on. Separated from his sons and kin by Flesh-puppets and Harlequinn. He drank deeper from the Singers talisman. Forced to draw upon greater and greater amounts of psychic power to keep up with his enemies. The remaining solitaires and the High Avatar fought perfectly together, pushing the Primarch to his limits. The High Avatar was fast and powerful, playing the role of Cegorach and channeling a drop of the Clown God&apos;s power. This troupe master Avatar danced around Iskandar, exploiting every opening created by the Solitaries. The carved bloody marks into the demigod, all while whispering dark lies and cruel truths to the infuriated Primarch.</p><p>&quot;The thing you call father thinks of you as nothing but a tool.&quot; the Avatar called, jabbering away in its lyrical accent &quot; It is a miscarried god wearing a Mon&apos;Keigh skin. You are marked by She Who Thirsts. Even now I can see her fangs in you. Once you are used up and damned, he will cast you into the void or her mouth. Why do you think he clothed you in flesh, God-Golem? A vessel for the gods! Let us pass! We will erase the Emperor from this universe and save it. He is but another pawn of the Enemy. As deluded and mad as Chaos. You just need to let me pass, you poor, deluded thing.&quot;</p><p>Ignoring these taunts, a whisper stroked against the Primarchs mind. A faint alien thought of seductive potency. &quot;It is the right of sons to surpass their fathers. Let the Aeldari do what it will. Stop fighting the inevitable. Why struggle for 10,000 years against me, when I want nothing more than to embrace you?&quot;</p><p>The Dark Prince had found Iskandar. The Singer&apos;s Talisman drew from mankind&apos;s creativity and experience. Casting a bloody lure into the Warp for the youngest God. Now xhe had found him. Xer favorite Primarch, xer destined serpent. Slaanesh coveted the III Primarch, and would never let go. Iskandr felt the tendrils of corruption slither across his psyche. Even with a feast of Aeldari souls, he was what Slaanesh wanted. The Dark Prince desired him, as consort, scion, prophet, trophy, and champion. Intoxicated by arcane power and esoteric experiences, the Primarch laughed. Facing the Chaos God&apos;s lust and the Harlequins malice he proclaimed: &quot;I have tasted madness! It burns in my soul like a mighty star! It mine and mine alone. Xeno, Daemon, whatever comes, has no claim. This is my doom, you shall have no part in it.&quot;</p><p>Across the Warp a psychic thunderclap echoed, blowing away tendrils of corruption and shocking the Dark Prince. Iskandar knew his time was limited. The power drawn into his flesh was distorting him, infecting his mind with the Warp&apos;s poison. Yet he would not let this path of lunacy be dictated by another. To defend his father and ruin the schemes of both Chaos and the Aeldari, he would fight. Iskandar Basilious was going insane on his own terms.</p><p>Gene-forged flesh rippled and shifted. It became near impossible to tell where the psychedelic mist covering Iskandar ended and where his body started. Limbs ending with whips, talons, and blades faded in and out of being. His face was a spectral projection flickering between Imperial Adonais and eldritch rictus. The High Avatar took this manifestation of the demigods unraveling mind and body as an opportunity. With force sword in one hand and monofilament sting in the other. The Xeno plunged his weapons into the Primarchs twin hearts. Psychic plasma and thrashing filaments eviscerated the Primarchs organs.</p><p>Iskandar&apos;s legs buckled, his new talons and tentacles gripping the ash-covered floor. Where the Primarch once towered over the Avatar he now faced its mocking mask at eye level. Cupping his face like a lover the Avatar whispered ancient lullaby, willing the demigod to die. Removing one of the Dark Prince&apos;s destined Princes. Iskandar stared into the Harlequins eyes, hidden behind its dreadful mask, and smiled. From the iridescent fog covering them both, a blade erupted. An Uru-Blade in the shape of a stiletto knife shot through the Eldar&apos;s skull. With a super-sonic killing blow, the Primarch drove the dagger from one side of the Xeno&apos;s head to the other.</p><p>Stumbling back, like a drunken fool the Avatar grasped at the blade stuck through its brain. Dying neurons misfired as it thrashed pointlessly until the spasms of death ended and its movements became fluid again. Blood far too bright to be human dribbled down its costume as the Harlequin cocked it head to one side. Looking into the eyes of the mask, a chill erupted through Iskandar. The Avatar was dead and its master stared at him through stolen eyes. Cegorach had come to orchestrate the performance.</p><p>Spinning with grace beyond any mortal Aeldari, the Cegorach-Avatar started to clap. Dead-hands cracking sarcastic applause, soon mimicked by his followers. The Harlequins disengaged from the Imperials as one, applauding and making gestures of mocking congratulation. Soon the flesh-puppets took up the display as well. They began to fill the air with a thunderous ovation. After a perfect Terran minute, it stopped, instantly. Where echoes should have followed there was perfect silence, as if some great conductor had turned off sound.</p><p>Cegorach-Avatar saluted the Primarch and spoke, the god&apos;s words were eldritch caresses upon the psyche. &quot;Oh, noble sons of Terra! You have performed wonderfully. In the face of betrayal, death, and madness you held firm, doing everything possible to save your God-Caller. You sacrificed your minds and bodies for an unloving father-smith. Such a tragedy, such talent, such will. All wasted on a wasted second chance. You rage against the dying of the light, uncaring that this struggle is what will extinguish the stars. The Mon-Keigh King will only lead your species to a miserable end. I will not insult you by asking you, his most loyal thralls, to abandon him. I will, however, tell you this. The Anathema must die for the universe to live. His own arrogance and blind ego convince him otherwise.&quot;<br>Taking a deep bow the Cegorach-Avatar continued: &quot;Now, the show must go on. The betrayed Mon-keigh suffer and struggle. Fighting against impossible odds and enemies beyond your ken. Do you see light at the end of the path? It is but an illusion. Rage! Rage mon-keigh. Show the universe your willful madness!&quot;</p><p>Still bowed low, the Cegorach-Avatar lifted its face up to peer at Iskandar. With a dramatic gesture, it grabbed its smile. A hand on the masks upper and lower lips. In an act of grotesque farce, the Clown God pulled the mask&apos;s mouth apart. Stretching it open wider and wider, all without breaking its form. In the space drawn between the mask&apos;s fangs was a void of pitch darkness. Just as the mask would stretch no further, the darkness erupted. From it came to light. Blinding, ugly light.</p><p>The Cegorach-Avatar seemed to deflate as it disgorged a hulk of fire and gilded light. Standing before Iskandar was the newest member of the Dance without End. An Eldar clad in gilded armor of sickening ostentatiousness. The Xeno stood taller and broader than any Aeldari Iskandar had seen. Layers of sigils, medallions and skull ornaments covered it. In one hand it held a sword of cruel flames. In the other a vicious talon. Where other Harlequin wore masks of oversized expressions or haunting plainness. This Harlequin was clad in a helm crafted like a screaming corpse. A rotten death rictus cast in chipped gold. Staring into the mask, Iskandar realized what he was facing. Before he could voice his horror, the quickly collapsing Cegorach-Avatar proclaimed: &quot;In this act, the Mon-Keigh Corpse-Tyrant joins the performance. The infant Chaos God of Oppression joining the dance without end. Alongside its siblings of the first order of Solitaries!&quot;<br>Turning to face Iskandar the Corpse-Tyrant lifted its sword and charged. It roared in twined voices: &quot;Purge the unclean/Mael Dannan&quot;</p><p>Moving like some ancient serpent of Terra Iskandar dodged its blow. Hissing in pain as a wave of flames forged in mindless hate scalded his skin. Diving past the Corpse-Tyrant he pulled the Uru-Blade from the Avatar&apos;s corpse and faced the Xeno parody. With new vigor, the Harlequins attacked the Imperials who fought back with reckless abandon in turn. The mockery of their wounded liege ignited the blood-fury even in the Custodes.</p><p>Desperately, Iskandar fought the Corpse-Tyrant. Its blows matched meteor strikes in power and heat. Wounded and exhausted, the Primarch fought against this horror almost beyond imagining. Protected by Cegorach and infused with Anathemic energy, the Corpse-Tyrant easily matched the Primarch. If this continued much longer Iskandar would be struck down. Feeling his mounting corruption seeping into his soul, Iskandar laughed. The Dark Gods wanted him to strike down his father. What better way to deny them by killing this mockery.</p><p>Space/Time twitched and convulsed. The Primarch pulled maddening amounts of psychic energy into the materium, flooding his body and mind with unbound magik. Iskandar was shedding his corporeal form. All that was left was the innate spirit of a Primarch glutted on the power of Mankind&apos;s imagination, bleeding out of his body and dissolving it. More ideas than matter, the Primarch attacked. Blades and thoughts, equally sharp, lashed and bashed the Corpse-Tyrant. Its flaming sword and wicked claw scything at Iskandar&apos;s mercurial form. Sobbing and laughing the Primarch slithered around his foe. Attacking with everything he had.</p><p>An inferno of dominating light clashed with a storm of rabid colors. The Imperials and Harlequin soon found themselves disengaging from each other. The energy discharged from the duel of demi-gods created a gale-force, sending corpse-puppets flying off the cracked plaza and forcing the warriors to brace themselves. The Corpse-Tyrant was an abomination that mocked the Emperor and mimicked him in a twisted way. At its core was a powerful and arrogant Eldar. In another life, he might have become an Archeon, Trope Master or Autarch. Yet today, Cegorach had stolen his fate. The god manipulated and twisted the possible champion into a titan of ego and psychic power, protected from Slaanesh and abetted by the Harlequins. Creating a sacrificial lamb glutted on dominion and arrogance. Cegorach&apos;s altar is the stage, and his sacrifice played its role perfectly. The possible champion&apos;s soul ignited with stolen fire, creating a mockery of the Anathema which would burn itself to nothingness. Until then, it fought like a god and boasted the killing flames of the Fire-Tide.</p><p>It was a living inferno that burned away at Iskandar. The twisted warp-stuff infusing his body ignited in the presence of this false-Anathema. Screaming in delirious agony, the Primarch pushed through the flames, raining blows upon his foe and fighting for his last scraps of sanity. Overwhelmed by a billion, billion ideas, dreams, fantasies and delusions. The Primarch was rapidly succumbing to the Warp. As his mind eroded his power increased. Iskandar&apos;s soul was ripped open by the talisman, twisting him into a living warp-gate. A hole in the bottom of the Sea of Souls. Pouring out the raw stuff of possibility through the Primarch and onto his foe. This is what a Primarch is. It is a living warp-rift, given flesh and anchoring in mankind&apos;s psyche. That fundamental nature exploited to devastating effects. As Aeldari Corpse-Tyrant and Human Primarch raced to engulf each other in their death throes.</p><p>Space/Time along with matter itself distorted around the duel. Existence weakened under the strain of this clash. Power of this nature was rarely seen since the War in Heaven. They were dueling singularities, each desperately devouring each other. Not even a hint of humanoid, or even living shape could be seen in the thrashing storm. Instead, they were two fonts of runaway energy. Each witness saw it in a unique way. The Harlequins saw songs, and stories exchanged in a clash of wit, spirits waging a war in metaphor. The stoic Astartes and Custodes glimpsed the clash of blades and the discharge of weapons. Each group interpreting the incomprehensible through a personal filter.</p><p>The duel reached its conclusion as the technicolor dynamo that once was a Primarch grew in size. Swallowing the searing flames of the Corpse-Tyrant like some massive black-hole devouring a dying star. The Corpse Tyrant used his own soul to fuel its dreadful power. Iskandar, by contrast, had only to open up the floodgates hidden within him. In a keening screech that somehow sounded both like a blaze being extinguished in cold water and musical strings snapping, the Corpse Tyrant was snuffed out.</p><p>A wave of subconscious disgust rippled through both the Custodes and surprisingly the Harlequin. Even in this play-act version of the Great Game, the death of an Anathema to unbound psychic power resonated darkly. Little time to contemplate was given. The vaguely spherical maelstrom of impossible colors that had been Iskandar was growing. Losing cohesion, the storm grew larger and larger. A living warp-rift that threatened to swallow worlds if unchecked.</p><p>Every eye on this warp-swept battlefield of ashen remains and splintered crystal watched the Primarch&apos;s doom grow. His physical form destroyed and his soul turned into a gaping Hellmouth. Iskandar Basileus could only scream as he died. Sanity and substance peeled away from him. Leaving the flayed soul of a young god unleashed. Enraptured by this beautiful nightmare, no one noticed a kneeling figure stand. Constantin Valdor, First of the Ten Thousand, rose to do his duty.</p><p>With the Apollonian Spear in hand, the Captain-General walked towards the dying Primarch with calm confidence. Moving between the lines of Astartes and Custodes who stood by, shocked by his sudden movement. Valdor approached the maddened Primarch, the lashing wind and warp-lightning coming from it unnoticed by the Custodian. The Aeldari watched with alien curiosity. They had discounted him as another Mon-Keigh golem. A crucial mistake. Valdor had not spent the battle sulking away with the Emperor&apos;s fallen form, hiding from his duty. He had been engaged in a higher calling. Putting his, mind, body and soul to the test. He had communed with the damaged soul of the Emperor, providing the Master of Mankind a handhold in the materium to guide his efforts to heal. Now the Anathema of Mankind stirred in his healing slumber. Unable to awake, but aware enough to direct His Spear.</p><p>With the words of his creator echoing in his mind. Constantin Valdor pushed through the ever-growing waves of power pouring from the Primarch. Step by step, he pushed through distorted space/time and shrugged off eldritch energies. If the warp-rift he approached caused him any distress, Valdor did not show it. Imperial and Xeno alike were transfixed as the Captain-General marshaled his spear. Taking a battle stance, honed over decades of experience and centuries of genetic lore. Constantin Valdor leaped forward and plunged his Emperor-forged Guardian Spear into the gaping hole at the center of the psychic maelstrom the III Primarch had become.</p><p>For a moment nothing happened. Time seemed to slow and the bleak cacophony coming from the rift faded to a murmur. Then the hole in space/time that was once a Primarch detonated. As loud as a supernova and as gentle as a soap-bubble., it ruptured in a conflagration of impossible colors and sound. Pierced by a weapon forged with the Emperor&apos;s soul, it lost all pretense of form. A shockwave that defied proper description radiated out, sending Xenos flying, buffeted by warp-gales and forcing transhumans to the ground. Lanced like a festering boil, the Warp-Rift exploded violently. The stuff of manic imagination washed over Proxima and cut the strings of billions of walking corpses. Aeldari fled, scurrying into hastily summoned webway gates and fleeing whatever doom was to come. Astartes wordlessly begged for their Primarch, too stunned to do more than stand and watch the indescribable display before them.</p><p>As the wave of esoteric and figment-energy dissipated a grim sight came into view. Gone was the Warp-Rift. Forced shut by Valdor and his spear, shut in the most pragmatic way possible. Where once had been a seething rift was a mangled corpse. It was burnt and broken thing, barely a seared torso and head, impaled through its chest by the shining Apollonian Spear. The III Primarch had burned his mind, body, and soul to ash. His life extinguished and the Singers Talisman deactivated. Its golden disc embedded in the Primarch&apos;s blackened flesh.</p><p>A scream of despair filled the sooty air of Proxima. The III Legion rushed forward to there fallen genesire. Valdor pulled his spear from the Primarch and let his limp corpse fall. Turning to the Astartes, Valdor spoke. &quot;The Emperor did not create the Primarchs to be frail things. Even less so for the two, he intends to last beyond eternity. My Spear is more than a weapon. It is a tool and a method of your Genesire&apos;s rebirth. If he is worthy of it.&quot;</p><p>Fulgurite formed from a cast-off bolt of the Emperor&apos;s light could kill or resurrect. In another timeline, it had been used for wonders and terrors. It had cured the madness of a tortured Salamander and killing immortal traitors. Those feats were accomplished by a piece of captured lightning. A literal hunk of sharpened rock in comparison to what pierced Iskandar. The Apollonian Spear was forged by the Master of Mankind and anointed with his very essence. At the Emperor&apos;s instruction, Valdor had impaled the III Primarch. Thrusting a spark of pure light into the broken demigod in the process.</p><p>That spark flowed through Iskandar, touching the shattered bits of his soul, pulling them together and healing him with his Father&apos;s love. Golden light flowed through the dead Primarch. The light only had to push the immortal biology and eternal soul of Iskandar back to its purpose. Like his younger brother Vulkan, Iskandar was a perpetual.</p><p>With a scream of life restored, the fallen Primarch breathed anew. Psychic light danced across his broken skin and ruined muscles like some celestial aurora. Flesh regrew and flames of golden light danced around Iskandar, steadily growing in intensity as life poured back into the Primarch. The Singers Talisman melted into his flesh. The Ur-Gold flowed through reborn veins and into the wound Valdor had inflicted. Transhuman flesh and micro-wafers of tesseract-etched gold came together, creating a mark of gold upon his breast roughly resembling the shape of flames while still retaining its countless inscriptions and connection to the warp.</p><p>Struggling to his fast regrowing feet, Iskandar held his hands out and cried a call of victory. Flames erupted from his body, flaring out from his arms in the shape of golden wings that were brighter than the sun and just as glorious. At that moment, the Primarch was more than that. He was a Phoenix. The light of rebirth heralding mankind&apos;s birth. The Emperor&apos;s Champion. His Phoenix Reborn.</p><p>As the flames settled, the III Legion knelt before the Primarch. The statuesque demigod walked through the dying flames and beckoned his sons to stand. With a pulse of telekinesis, Iskandar plucked the Uru-Blade from the ground and held it up. Breathing deep and examining himself, Iskandar let out a small chuckle. &quot;A Phoenix indeed. Well played, Father..&quot;</p><p>Bowing in gratitude to Valdor, the Primarch spoke. &quot;Thank you my kin. I owe my life and sanity to you. I am his Phoenix Blade, I shall burn bright and strike hard for the Emperor. Now and forever.&quot;</p><p>Valdor only nodded curtly. His own mind was flooded with a psychic backlash from Iskandar. His spear pulled memories and emotions from all he killed. Such was its burden and power. In that moment of the Primarch&apos;s first death, some of his essence touched Valdor. The Captain-General had been shocked by what he felt. Love, love for the Emperor and love by the Emperor towards his son. It was a primitive and brutish thing compared to the loyalty of a Custodes to the Emperor, but it struck Valdor with its sheer intensity. At that moment, he understood something. The Primarchs were far more dangerous than he could ever imagine. That love could so easily turn to hate, and it left a weakness in his Master&apos;s armor. Yet, something deep within the Custodian was moved. Some parts of himself felt that connection and wondered if the Primarchs might be more than he could imagine.</p><p>Raising his sword, Iskandar spoke to his legionaries: &quot;Hear me my sons! From the Ashes of War! We rise! From this day on, we are the Phoenix Blades. The Champions of the Imperium. In his name, we shall be the flame that burns away the darkness and lights the future!&quot;<br>A cheer erupted from his sons. All raising their bloody and blunted weapons. At that moment the sky ignited in plasma-fire. Ripping from the Immaterial in a risky Warp-Jump was the Bucephalus. Ignoring its own safety the ship had arrived straight from the Warp and into Proximan orbit. Any lesser vessel would have been dragged into the gravity well or buried in an astral body. The Cognatu Ferrum had used all of its formidable intellect to propel the Emperor&apos;s chariot to its wounded master. Looking up, Iskandar watched a flock of landing craft and drop-pods rain from the ship. The Imperium had come and the Emperor was safe.</p><p>At Valdor&apos;s direction, the still sleeping form of the Emperor was ferried onto a Custodes landing craft that promptly took him to a hidden sanctum within the Bucephalus. It was a place of peace and meditation where the Master of Mankind could heal. Iskandar cloaked his naked form in a procured robe and started giving orders. The Centauri Cluster would be firmly in Imperial hands by the time his father awoke. Moving to a landing craft to take up command upon the Bucephalus, the Primarch paused. Turning back he approached the splintered remains of the Solitaires who had driven him to his first death. The bodies were in too poor condition for Omophageaic use. Soaked in Warp-taint and stinking of the Dark Prince&apos;s desire. Instead, they could fulfill another purpose.</p><p>Across the Cluster all 52 systems of the Centauri Cluster a message was beamed. The appearance of the Many Colored King&apos;s &quot;Angels&quot; and their true identity. How they were scheming Xeno&apos;s who had killed all of Proxima rather than let the Emperor expose them. Iterator spun truth and propaganda together artfully. Telling of the Aeldari Fall and its consequences upon the galaxy. Within a Terran month, 90% of temples to the Many-Colored King would be ruined.</p><p>Location: The Warp<br>Date: ~884.M30 (Impossible to accurately measure)</p><p>It had been close to three Terran weeks. The Emperor had slept within his private chambers for that entire time, all the while pulling his molecules back together and consolidating his soul. Cegorach had failed to kill him. The clown god had put on a show for him and his servants. He had watched the battle from his undying slumber with bitter fury. The entire thing was a mockery of the God-Emperor and his Imperium. A chastising message meant for the Emperor alone. Informing him that Cegorach knew of the timelines shift and that any attempt to change it further would be pointless.</p><p>Close to fully healed and with the Harlequin Assassins scattered into the Webway, it seemed time for the Emperor to confront the clown god. Diving into the Sea of Souls, the Emperor prepared a lure for his foe. Like a freediver of ancient Terran reef-people, he plunged deep into the Immaterium. His senses focused on a group of souls being pulled into the realm of Slaanesh. Thirteen Solitaires, each fighting desperately to escape the jaws of She who Thirsts. Struggling in the caustic depths, begging their god to rescue them. These damned souls felt the pull of Chaos and then something else&#x2026; Something bright and terrible. Peering up with frightened witch-sight, a specter beyond comprehension filled the warp. Riding upon great wings of fire, a Raptor of hardened light and ordered thought came with outstretched talons.</p><p>In the form of a bird of prey, the Master of Mankind swept down into the realm of Chaos and plucked the Solitaires up in his mighty talons. With a great downbeat of innumerable wings, the Emperor ripped through the Warp up towards the shallows. Into the light of the Astronomicon. Like the cruel predator, this form was modeled after the Emperor smashed the stolen souls on a cliff-edge of solid light. Circling the traumatized souls with wings of fire, he spoke. &quot;<em>++ You hurt my child and arranged the deaths of so many of mankind. This will not go unanswered. Yet more pressing matters are at hand. You are tokens of parley. Pray to your performance of a deity he agrees to meet. If not, I will burn you all. It will hurt less than what the Great Enemy intended, but you will be snuffed from existence in considerable pain.++&quot;</em></p><p>Almost on cue, an explosion of technicolor light came into being around the Emperor. A grinning mask of pale silver appeared. Forming the face of something cloaked in starlight and mystery. It very form an oscillating thing of broken images and stars. Cegorach had come.</p><p>A hand composed of iridescent streams swept across the cliff of light. Plucking the Solitaires up and fading away with them. Turning to face the Emperor, Cegorach bowed in an extravagant display of false respect. &quot;-<em>Oh great and glorious Anathema! What a wonder it is to see you! How goes the genocide, the pogroms, the atrocities beyond count my glorious overlord of righteousness. What business do you have with me? Oh! Is it about that little spat on Proxima? Please don&apos;t hold it against me. I just hoped to save the universe from eternal impossible torment.-&quot;</em></p><p>Scowling through golden eyes, the Emperor observed the Clown-God and felt disgusted at the being&apos;s mockery. &quot;<em>++ You wear mask after mask ancient one. Dancing and distracting. I am a monster, a tyrant with the blood of countless on my hands. Yet you are so much worse. You prance about in the face of a God-Construct and pretend to be just an escaped entity like The Bloody Handed One and the Life-Mother. I know the truth of what you are. I pulled it from the minds of your Hrud toys. You are no god, natural or made. You are a creator of them. The Trickster, the last of the Old Ones.++&quot;</em></p><p>For a split second the silver mask adorning the Clown &quot;God&quot; shifted. Its smile no longer one of mocking humor, but a snarl of bared fangs. <em>&quot;- Oh I am one of the first, just not the last. Some of my comrades yet linger. One was even upon your prized blue-jewel the day of your birth. He watched the Shamans slit their throats atop the tallest mountain. That ritual would have failed without him. Yet another pack of near-animals dying in vain. Hoping to save themselves from the Primordial Annihilator. If the Craftsman had not guided them, you would have never been born. All that is left of him resides in your primitive soul. I guess&#x2026; that makes me your kin of sorts.-&quot;</em></p><p>Flaring his wings the Emperor flexed talons of cold gold: &quot;<em>++ You lie, Vaul is but a living tool like the rest of your created gods. A broken thing made to build and build. It could not interfere with another species, let alone help my creation ++&quot;</em></p><p>A cackle emanated from the darkness and the Old One spoke &quot;<em>++ So bright and shiny, yet so dull! I speak not of the creator-god we built for the Aeldari. It was just another tool. I speak of the user of those tools. My kin-comrade the Craftsman. Oh he was glorious. Worlds, species, weapons, and so many wonders. All forged by his will. He made the universe brighter with every passing cycle. For you to be his final legacy... disgraceful. An ignorant tyrant who would burn the universe in a temper tantrum rather than face the truth. -&quot;</em><br>&quot;<em>++What truth would that be, Clown?++&quot; </em>roared back the Emperor. He knew he was a monster, he knew few beings in the universe who would commit more evil than him. Yet this failed relic of the first warp travelers dared to judge him. The Trickster and his kin had unleashed the Orks, the Enslavers, the Dark God, even the C&apos;tan by their negligence.</p><p>Glaring through black eye-slits Cegorach sneered: <em>&quot;- The truth you infantile Anathema is the only way for the Universe to live is for you to die. The Cabal is foolish, not able to see past their own notions. Humanity is not the danger. It. Is. You. As long as you live the Chaos Gods will feed on your sins and scheme to birth the Fifth of their number. You are nothing but the infection vector for Chaos. Deluding yourself that an impossible shining path will save you and your species. If you survive past your Genocidal Conquests then we are all doomed.-&quot;</em></p><p>The Emperor responded softly: &quot;<em>++ The Shining Path is not impossible. If my people can walk it then Chaos can be destroyed and this universe and every universe will be saved ++&quot;</em></p><p>In a voice that could shatter the heavens and drive mortals mad, the Trickster screamed back. &quot;<em>- IF! IF! IF! IF! You walk a path you don&apos;t even fully know. One misstep, one mistake, and we all suffer worse than death. All it will take is a single flaw and you damn yourself and the universe. You failed once before, Anathema. What is to say you will not fail again?-&quot;</em></p><p>To that, the Emperor had no answer, or at least not one he wished to give. Moving close to the Emperor the Trickster&apos;s mask became a weeping face and the anger dissipated. Instead was a soft almost pleading voice. &quot;<em>- I need you to understand why you need to die. If you live to conquer this galaxy, everyone dies. If you butcher and burn your way to dominion the Warp will respond. The Four will find a way to set the birth of the Fifth into motion. You nearly died on Proxima, to a blatant trap. Anathema, just because your Godlings gestated in your sight does not mean they will not destroy you. I was there when Eldanesh died. I was there when his most loyal friend and creation gained that cursed bloody hand. You will not be any different. The fruit of your labor will poison you in the end. Eventually, something will break you. I doubt anything the Dark Gods can muster can truly kill you, but something will break you. It will wound you, Anathema. Then out of your broken body and soul, the Fifth god will be born. You met that abomination as it gripped its last bits of sanity and sent a message. The God-Emperor on the cusp of true and dreadful apotheosis. All roads lead to that or worse.-&quot;</em></p><p>With a gentleness out of character for the crass Old One the Trickster spoke again: &quot;<em>- That is the shining path you so boldly walk. Certain doom where the stakes are impossibly high. I offer you another option. Within you lies the power of the Anathema. The incarnate sanity of the galaxy. It&apos;s flames grow bright, with the souls of billions. Right now if you were to be truly extinguished. That energy would not be shackled to a Soul-Engine or warped by primitive prayer. It would be released. Burning the Warp in a way the Talisman of Seven Hammers could never dream. Your death will maim the Gods. Your soul unleashed into the warp with your death. If you were to die, truly die. The Chaos Gods would be banished from this existence in your funeral pyre. The ancient doom we set in motion all those millions of years ago to stop the C&apos;tan finally ended. The Galaxy would be at peace.- &quot;</em></p><p>Silent, except for the roar of psychic flames the Emperor pondered this before asking: &quot;<em>++ That may be true, but what of the threats within the Material. Even with the Chaos Gods dead and their minions broken. The other abominations yet live. The Orks, The Rangda, not to mention the Yngir and the Hunger Between the Stars. What is your answer to the other dooms for my people? I would gladly die for mankind if it meant their safety. This plan of yours is flawed ++&quot;</em></p><p>A smile deeper than an event horizon cut its way across the Tricksters mask: &quot;<em>- You answer the question by asking it. The Orks and the Rangda are my people&apos;s creations. While I lack the control we once had, they are still puppets. With the Chaos Gods gone and you gone. The only species capable of conquering the galaxy will be the Ork and Rangda. Who will then fight for galactic supremacy. I will let neither of them win. For ten thousand years two of the most deadly and powerful organisms in creation will hone themselves upon each other. Becoming weapons beyond compare. So when the Yngir wake they will find a galaxy of war-thralls ready to crush them once and for all. They will be at the weakest when they awake and the Krorks were meant to fight them at their strongest. When the Great Devourer comes it will face a parasite cultivated over eons. The Rangda will cripple the Hive-Fleets for generations. Infesting them and wounding that great unfathomable intelligence. If the collective mind refuses to leave this galaxy it will face the combined wrath of the Orkish and Rangda oversouls. I was there when they were first built. I know just how to break them in such a way the ensuing destruction would lobotomize the Great Devourer along with the Orks and Rangda.-&quot;</em></p><p>With a gesture, the Trickster pulled up a thousand Webway portals and continued: <em>&quot;-Then as the dust settles my chosen will reclaim the galaxy. Thousands of species and cultures have been selected to survive this apocalypse. I will hide them deep within the Web Way under my protection. Growing strong and ready to reclaim the galaxy from the ashes. Mankind would be among them of course. My servants have long helped or observed the branches of your species who merit it. Interex, Khazukan, Auretian, Inwit, and many others. Worthy to ride out the storm and carry the name of Homo Sapiens into the distant future. I have protected my chosen from the Fall, the War in Heaven, the K&apos;nib conflicts and so much more. Mankind will survive without you. It can only survive without you Anathema.-&quot;</em></p><p>The Emperor responded with stoic composure. <em>&quot;++ You are correct, that would be the best and most efficient method to ensure the Galaxies survival. Kill the gods and Cauterize the warp, preventing them from being reborn in this timeline. Burn the galaxy and let those worthy ascend from the ashes. I will not allow it. Your plan would save our universe, but only our universe. The Great Enemy will still be out there. Feeding off countless realities. I walk the path that will kill them once and for all. I can do more than just save one universe. I can save them all. Mankind will Ascend. The Imperium under me will guide them on a path to surpass you and your get. Trickster, I have fought too long and too hard to let you run and hide with my people. ++&quot;</em></p><p>Shedding the form of mighty raptor the Emperor took the form he considered his most natural. A simple man with bronze skin, and golden eyes. Looking up at the ancient Trickster-being he spoke. With a voice both calm and terribly, terribly cold. &quot;<em>++ If I fail, I can always start again. The God-Emperor reached back and gifted souls and knowledge to me. If I fail I will do the same as the God-Emperor. With each failure, I will grow in power, with each universe that slides towards dissolution I will learn. The souls of each timeline will be safe within me. Then all that suffering and horror will be worth it. I will exist in living death upon the Golden Throne for millions of years if I have to. I have to win once, and I have all the time possible.++&quot;</em></p><p>The Trickster shuddered, its nebulous body recoiled from the idea of such horror. &quot;<em>- That is madness. Every failure will birth another universe of horrors. I doubt actuality could handle the strain. All that death, all that pain. You could save only so many from each attempt. You would sentence quintillions to death for this impossible dream!? You play with forces beyond even your understanding Anathema. You are mad Atham the Revelator.- &quot;</em></p><p>Smiling up at the being that wore gods like masks, Revelation said: &quot;<em>++ I am not insane, I know that if the Shining Path succeeds just once, all will be worth it. All the evils of Chaos and every other horror possible will have never existed. For all your power Trickster, you can barely detect the shifting of time. You know the God-Emperor sent a message from the Grimdark future and it changed the course of history. What you do not know is how many times this has occurred. What attempt do you think I am on Trickster? How many times do you think I have listened to this patronizing argument? My plan is working Trickster, far better than yours. I hope for your sake. That when my son Magnus finally claims the Black Library from you, he is feeling merciful. If not, you will make a fine research specimen.++&quot;</em><br>With those terrible words, the Emperor faded from this meeting place. Leaving the last true Old One shaken and scared. Speaking to none other than himself and his memories the Trickster said: &quot;<em>- Oh Craftsman, what have you unleashed? What possessed you to help those hominids. They grew in the shadow of Chaos and C&apos;tan, and you decided to hand them the keys to the cosmos.-&quot;</em></p><p>Back upon the Bucephalus the Emperor awoke. His body healed and his soul restored. Rising from the crystalline altar within his chambers that focused psychic power. The Emperor opened his eyes and stared out across the cosmos. As attendants and Custodes rushed to him he remarked: &quot;Still so much to do. The Great Work must go on.&quot;</p>
