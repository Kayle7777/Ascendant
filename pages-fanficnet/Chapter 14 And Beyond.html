<p>Chapter 14: Tales from the Palace and Beyond (Second Half)</p><p>Part III Rangda Rising</p><p>Date- Year 4781 of the Age of Nightmares (local calendar)</p><p>Location- Minish: Industrial age human world in the Halo Stars.</p><p>The Things first noise was both its birth-cry and its chrysalis death scream. The Host-Beasts final moments of despair and disgust flickered through Its mind as it fully awoke. The Thing had lived for months under the host-beasts skin, feeding on nerve cells and steadily influencing it. During that time it had been non-sentient, just a cluster of Viral-Nerves following pre-weaved orders.</p><p>These orders had plucked at the Host-Beasts minds, at first simple intrusive thoughts that steadily grew into obsessions, then actions. It started simple, letting a drop of infected oxygen-carrier fall into the meal it was preparing for its brood. This quickly evolved and magnified as the Things influence increased. Each action worked to spread the Things kindred across the Host-Beasts world.</p><p>A collection of Host-Beasts snuck into an H20 plant and dumped chunks of infected offal into the supply. Dissident organizations were joined or formed. Livestock was infected and sacrificed to spread the Things fellows to millions more. After months of this, the signal came. A note sung through the warp, it struck the infant-things across the World and drove them into a frenzy. The time for subtlety was over. Hosts-Beasts rampaged across the world, crippling and infecting it as the Things inside them devoured what was left of their nervous system.</p><p>After a month of this anarchy, the first generations of infected were fully consumed and the Things inside them awoke to the world just as the seeders arrived. This particular Thing took its first few moments to examine its Flesh. It was a binary oxygen processor, well-formed thanks to physical labor and good nutrients. It was a good host that would serve the Thing well.</p><p>Next, it glanced around its surroundings. It stood within a Crater that had once been a Civilization Center. Broken structures and ruined infrastructure dotted the landscape. Around it was millions of Host-Beasts. Some like it were fully awakened and examining the world. Others were still being consumed and stood in mute agony as their neurons were devoured bit by bit.</p><p>The last piece of the surroundings to register was by far the largest and most important. A great fleshy spire stuck out of the Craters center. It reached into the cloud banks and the Thing noticed vents near the top pouring atmosphere adapted virons into the world&apos;s water cycle. On some instinctive level, The Thing knew the spire was buried into the planet as far below as it rose into the sky, and that it tainted the soil and aquifer as well.</p><p>The silence was broken by a song, a horrific melody that blasted from vehicle sized vocal structures that dotted the spire. It was interwoven with Psychic signals that combined to touch the Things flesh and soul. To its Host-Beast the Psi-Noise would have been a thing of mind-shattering insanity, that would have caused it to gouge its flesh and tear its throat apart screaming. To the Thing, it was the most utterly beautiful thing it had ever experienced and would ever experience.</p><p>As one the millions of infected marched towards the Siren Song. The Song was a screaming-whisper on its mind, a soft enchanting rhythm that rewrote Viral-Clusters and started to convey a great saga. The Thing could not understand the tale, no matter how hard it tried it could not fully grasp the Psychic Epic being written into the minds and souls of those who were meant to hear it.</p><p>Only two things made it through the cacophony and into the Things mind. First was a command. Enter the Conqueror Worm. The Things still developing neural-equivalent correctly deduced the spire was this Conquering Worm. As it got closer the point of entry also became obvious. Building-sized mooring spikes stabbed out of it into the dirt. They were colossal bone-structures that supported the Worm. Each was hollow and fluted, allowing access points for the newborns to climb into and enter the Worm.</p><p>The second decipherable bit was less practically important but reality shaking to the newborn thing. It was an identity, what it was and why it was. The thing was a thing no longer. It was a Rangdan, and it had been born to claim its genesis-right.</p><p>The Rangdan along with its millions of siblings clambered into the spike and ascended the ghoulish stairway that comprised the innards of it. Hundreds of thousands of young Rangdans clambered up the spike. Using processes as instinctual to it as flight is to an avian The Rangdan started modifying its host.</p><p>No longer hampered by the need for subtlety The Rangdans Virons spread rapidly through the host-beast. Muscle cells were contaminated and twisted on the molecular level to reach states stronger and more efficient than ever originally possible. Energy careful eased from the inverted tapestry fueled hyper-mitosis and the natural mutagenic effect of that realm was weaponized.</p><p>Mutations and Cancers were harvested to provide more material. Hair shrunk into the scalp and prepared to be repurposed. Calluses appeared on flesh and were cultivated and sculpted into dermal armor. Each few-millimeter sized cluster of Rangdan Pseudo-Nerves acted independently of each other and drew from the inverted tapestry the small amount of matter and energy their meta-souls could.</p><p>The Rangdan was careful to not synchronize them or draw too much in order to prevent the things that dwelt in that realm from noticing it. Not all of his kin followed that instinct and sought to push beyond, to reach greater heights. A sound that was a mix of tearing flesh, screaming and an electrical hum occansily reverberated through the spine as one of the foolish ones met their fate. One of these failed erupted a dozen meters behind the Rangdan into a mutating hulk of twisted broken flesh that muled for death.</p><p>A twinge of annoyance filled the Rangdans mind, he was too far away to enjoy the bounty of flesh provided by the failure. It&apos;s closer siblings would feed well upon it. A Rangdan instinctively knew the more organic matter one possessed the more powerful you are. No matter how skilled a crafter is they are still limited by the amount of resources they have to work with.</p><p>Eventually, after several hours The Rangdan reached his destination. The Top of Spine where it met the Conqueror Worm. A massive aperture formed of some sort of gel stood before them. The stream of Rangdans slowly but surely entered the gel. The instant they did an unseen current whisked them away to parts unknown. Finally, it came The Rangdans turn. It expected some sort of resistance but instead, it was like walking into a pool of warm water.</p><p>Trusting the instinctual pulses that had guided it true so far the Rangdan entered it fully and took a deep breath of the fluid. The semi-solid liquid poured down the Rangdans throat and into its respiratory and digestive system. It was nutrient and oxygen-rich and seemed to independently recycle waste to keep the Rangdan alive and healthy. Giving itself over to the current the Rangdan felt itself pulled along a great capillary-like structure to parts unknown.</p><p>The influx of nutrients and sense of safety allowed the Rangdan to allow itself to truly start rebuilding its flesh as it traveled. New ideas and instincts flooded the Rangdan and it began to consume and rebuild the Host-Beasts flesh into something far greater. After months of riding the current, the Rangdan no longer resembled its host beast in any way.</p><p>Its sensory organs were improved and expanded upon. Viral-Nerve Clusters were expanded and advanced to increase intellect and memory. Bones reknit into more efficient shapes. The Rangdan&apos;s form had been crafted into something far better than what evolution had forged the Host-beast into. Once it felt its body was at the peak efficiency available to it the Rangdan let out a Psycho-Chemical signal.</p><p>The current shifted and the Rangdan has pulled away from the Maturation-veins. The song increased in volume in clarity as it flowed into a separate chamber. About a hundred other Rangdans drifted through the Cyst-Chamber. They resembled The Rangdan. Similar adaptations and structures, it knew these beings were its kin. Each born of the same Caste-Virus for the same purpose.</p><p>Drifting towards the Chambers center The Rangdan met its guide and the source of the song. It was at least three times its mass and most of that matter was concentrated in its massive cranium. Its skull was a titanic thing, housing millions of nerve-clusters. Its body seemed like an emaciated four upperlimbed version of the Rangdans own. It possessed dozens of light-sensing orbs and the majority locked onto the newcomer.</p><p>A Psychic voice echoed in The Rangdans mind: &quot;Greetings Newborn. I am Volg-Goid-Haskysh&apos;ura. Storyweaver of the Clan Goid, subject to the Volg House-Clan. You are a newborn of the Flesh-weaver Caste and Clan Akhon. Also subject to Volg House-Clan. My duty is to show the great history of Rangda to you and your kin.&quot;</p><p>With that, a psychic tendril reached out and let the Young Rangdan decipher the song. It was the story of its people, the story of a faith and civilization older than any other still living. The Song/Saga started like so many of its kind across the galaxy &quot;In the Beginning&quot;</p><p>The Rangdan did not know how much of it was words and how much memories. It could only float in the chamber like it&apos;s kin experiencing the same as the Psychic song washed over them. &quot;In the beginning there was nothing. The universe was a great cold empty void where Stars lived and died along and untouched for eons. Until it came!&quot;</p><p>A sense of joy and peace overcame the young one as its vision of the ancient void was changed by a Presence. &quot;The Weaver of Strands entered the galaxy like it had done so many others. It found the void lacking and sought to create the ultimate art to fill it. Each galaxy became a beautiful tapestry of life and ours was destined to be the greatest!&quot;</p><p>Dead worlds slowly turned green as nebulous clouds of energy traveled the galaxy, seeding and preparing to be gardened. &quot;Life sprang into being across the universe and eventually sentients developed. Two species, in particular, were selected to serve the Weaver of Strands. One too gathers material for the tapestry being woven. Another to assist in the weaving.</p><p>&quot;We the children of Rangda were chosen to travel the galaxy gathering strands of life to be used. The other were the Slaathion, they helped weave life into being and guide it to its appropriate place in the tapestry. For eons, the twin races served the Weaver and all was well.&quot;</p><p>Darkness started to seep into the vision, a hungering mass of chitin and teeth crawled between the stars and sought to slake its never-ending thirst. It was greater and more horrific than anything the Rangdan could ever imagine. &quot;Then the Hungering Entropy came. It sought to unravel and feast upon the galaxy like it had so many others. Not wanting to lose yet another creation to its ancient enemy the Weaver of Strands left the Galaxy in its favored two&apos;s care while it battled the Entropy.&quot;</p><p>&quot;For millennia we did our duty and cared for the growing Galaxy. Pruning unwanted species and shaping life into our creator&apos;s vision. The Weaver and the Entropy were evenly matched. The thing from between the stars could not be driven away nor consume the greatest artist. This stasis lasted an age before the Slaathion betrayed everything they stood for. Their great sages sought new weapons to battle the Entropy but discovered only folly.&quot;</p><p>The Vision shifted to a conclave of ancient Reptilians atop strange pyramid-temples reaching out with their minds into an unknown domain. &quot;They were the first to touch the Inverted Tapestry. A domain where strands of life both real and imagined dwelled. Reaching farther and farther into this impossible realm they and drank from the Well of Eternity. In that terrible moment, the Slaathion broke their oaths and betrayed us and their creator.&quot;</p><p>&quot;In their hubris, they declared the Weaver of Strands a false god and their sacred duties to guide and cull life as our Creator saw fit was wrong. Harnessing the powers of the Inverted Tapestry they battled us in a horrible rebellion. We fought with every ounce of our strength but it was not enough to overcome those ancients and the false-strands they empowered themselves with.&quot;</p><p>A new sight filled the Rangdans mind. Weapons of flesh and bone battled against armies of witch-forms across burning worlds. &quot;On our sacred world of Old Rangda our Eldest of Elders were forced to kneel and we were banished to the farthest reaches of the galaxy as punishment for refusing to betray our oaths. The Great Worm-Engine gifted to us by the Weaver was broken into three and our ancient Crown-Worlds were wiped clean of life.&quot;</p><p>&quot;For countless eons we watched our betrayers rule the galaxy and shape it in ways abhorrent to the Weavers wishes. The greatest of its art was undone and corrupted. Eventually, we discovered the truth of why the Slaathion had banished to the far reaches. Their visions into the Inverted Strands had told them of the greatest threat to the galaxy, and the ultimate evidence of our failure.&quot;</p><p>The distant tendrils of hungering darkness poured from the Void towards the galaxy. &quot;The Weaver of Strands had turned its back on us, the destruction of its work and theft of its tools had caused it to leave us. Now the Hungering Entropy sought to feed. It may have been weakened and scattered into countless tendrils by our benefactor&apos;s efforts but it still sought to feed.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Despair set in among our people, entire cities ended themselves, for oblivion was better than knowing we had been abandoned utterly. At our darkest moment, our greatest hero emerged. The Sage Nyarl was born of a Slaathion host-beast and had stolen their powers. Nyarl peered into the Inverted Strands and discovered the Truth.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The Conductor of Strands could forgive us! We could be taken back into our Master&apos;s fold if we completed the work. The Inverted Strands were another part of the Weaver&apos;s work. The reverse side of the great tapestry of life and by misusing its power the Slaathion threatened to unravel it and all life. Only by collecting and weaving together every thread could the tapestry be completed. Every strand of gene-code must be compiled, every soul unified under us.&quot;</p><p>Next, in the vision, the dark tendrils were attacked by a glowing sorcerer-sage at the head of Rangdan armies welding mythological flesh-forms. &quot;Unified under Nyarl&apos;s teaching we battled the Hungering Entropy like our creator and turned its own flesh into fodder for our growing race! Pale shadows of the original Great Worm Engine allowed us to burrow through the Inverted Tapestry and find new worlds.&quot;</p><p>&quot;With each tendril consumed, we grew in power. The Great Volaticus Stream formed from Nyarls own fluids remembered every monster we consumed and added its power to our own. For eons, this war inherited from our creator continued. It only ended when reality ripped open within the greatest Elder-Citadel-House of Rangda-in-Exile. The Slaathion had returned.&quot;</p><p>Pulled from the war against Void-born horrors the Rangdan watched Old-Sages upon hovering palanquins exit a hole in space into the heart of their growing Empire. &quot;They came bearing gifts of Genes never imagined and host beasts engineered perfectly for us. At first, we suspected trickery but the offer of peace was genuine. They offered an end to our exile in exchange for assistance against the greatest foe.&quot;</p><p>&quot;In the millions of solar orbits since our banishment, the Slaathion had spread life throughout the galaxy and twisted races into equals of them. Our humble skill in weaving the Inverted Strands was nothing compared to the betrayer&apos;s dominance of it. They had teased the Weavers secrets from the shattered Worm Engine and fused them with their new powers to create an ever-growing labyrinth located both in the Material and Immaterial.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yet for all these abominations and unholy powers, they had found a foe beyond them. Another aspect of the Hungering Entropy had been found by a weak-willed race of ghouls. Not cloaked in shadow and flesh but metal and stolen star-light. We saw the threat and offered our help to purge this evil from the galaxy.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Millions of years of exile had not taught us a simple lesson. Never trust a betrayer. We assumed they wanted our War-Forms and numbers to fight this conflict. How very wrong we were. The things we met were not Slaathion but their children are known as the Slaani. For the Slaathion along with their most prized creations had ascended past the limits of flesh and blood into pure Energy. They had become living conduits into the inverted realms and a prized meal for the Star-Eaters.&quot;</p><p>&quot;These broken beings sought not flesh to fight their wars, they had plenty in the haughty Crystal-Children or Spore-born Beasts. What they sought was our very Inverted-threads. To fight false-gods forged of metal they had created false-gods formed of interwoven inverted-threads. Great abominations had been formed all ready to fight this war. The Eternal-Winged Flame, The Twin Headed War, Serpents made of Starlight, And countless others. Now they bound our souls together as one into a horrific thing, and thus the False-Weaver was born&quot;</p><p>Billions of Rangdans had their Souls/Inverted Threads bound together into a colossal corpulent mass of rotting flesh. &quot;This abomination was the first of its kind, not born of a single aspect of a species but an aspect of all species. We were the anchor point for it, considered disposable if it failed.&quot;</p><p>&quot;For millions of cycles False-Gods battled with armies forged/born solely to kill their foes. Just as we feared the once peaceful if twisted Inverted Tapestry was tainted and started to unravel. False-Gods became True-Monsters and reality itself started to buckle from the horrors of the First War. The Material was collapsing under the strain of the Star-Eaters power and the Immaterial under the insanity of eternal-war along with the growing pantheon of madness.&quot;</p><p>&quot;In a final desperate attempt to save both sides of the tapestry the Slaathion decided to unleash the greatest and worst weapon ever devised by them. Before it was unleashed millions of those &quot;chosen&quot; by them were herded into the Labyrinth and shut away. The Great Ancients including our Lineage-Lord Volg were rewarded by the betrayers and sealed away also while the weapon was unleashed.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The Volaticus Stream&apos;s memories do not contain the truth of what happened. The Last message from the Slaathion simply said: &quot;To save all life we must first Enslave It.&quot; Time passes wrong within the Labyrinth so we know not how long we were sealed away. Eventually, it&apos;s great crystal gates opened and we entered a galaxy much changed. The Star-Eaters and their metal-bone slaves were gone and all sentient life had been wiped from the galaxy, save for the last few Slaathion who were utterly broken by what had occurred.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The insane survivors guided us back to our home worlds, where nothing remained except for ruins. From their they abandoned us. Some say they still seek to Change the Ways of the Galaxy, others whisper they Linger, a few say they created a world that would be, while the mad insist something stole their knowledge and power away to light a beacon of sanity.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It took little time for the Crystal-Children to become prouder and crueler than their creators. Once again we were banished to the farthest reaches of the galaxy to guide against tendrils of hungering flesh that never came. Many times we sought to reclaim our place as master of the galaxy and begin the Great Weaving of all life in the galaxy together. Each Time the False-Gods and their legions of worshiping Crystal-Witches struck us down.&quot;</p><p>&quot;So another age of exile began as the Inverted Tapestry slowly started to unravel again. Without the betrayer&apos;s guiding the weaving the galaxy had died to achieve started to break down as new unruly host-beasts to-be stained the fabric of unreality. Soon ancient things that slumbered since the end of the First War started to awaken. We knew once the Broken-Flesh King awoke the False-Weaver would soon stir.&quot;</p><p>&quot;To prevent falling under the abominations sway we scoured our souls and changed the very nature of The Rangda. Much was lost and will ever be but we were safe from it. Safe from the Stains upon the inverted tapestry and ignored by the bastard-heirs to usurpers we waited. Flesh-Beasts crafted to watch and rot tended the galaxy for us in our exile. The Worms that Walk would tell us when fate had been woven for us.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It took an age but we had waited longer for less. The folly of the Crystal-Children violated the Materium as they birthed their youngest god anew. Empire both young and old crumbled as the Inverted Tapestry was shredded apart by the Storm of Chaos. The time was right the galaxy rots around us and we can arise from its corpse and take it back for our Master! The Time has come for Rangda to Rise!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yet we are not alone in such ambitions. The Four reborn are greater and more terrible than ever before. They seek to make the Galaxy Burn in their name. Newborn and reborn Empires seek to claim our place. Something great and terrible burns through the warp. We shall strike them all down and weave them mind, body, and thread into our Tapestry. None can stand against The Rangdan Empire!&quot;</p><p>With that, the visions ended. The Rangdan did not know how long it had been in the chamber, the occupants had changed, but it now knew its purpose. History filled its mind and it left the chamber and rode the current to the destination it was meant for. The Rangdan entered a great Flesh-Womb. Where Millions of gestation chambers were tended to by similar looking kin.</p><p>Each grew a Flesh-Form of varying purpose to the Rangda species. It was the Young Rangdans duty to craft these tools. Slowly it moved through the fluid towards the great neural-structure in the center of the chamber. The Rangdan knew what it was, a connection to The Volaticus Stream. A nexus where organically encoded copies of every life-thread or flesh structure encountered by the Rangdan Empire was stored.</p><p>With tentative digits, it reached out to it and felt its mind and inverted-thread link with the great flesh-form. In gene-code it asked it a simple question &quot;Name?&quot;</p><p>Without hesitation, the Rangdan replied with the title it knew belonged to it since the end of the song/saga. &quot;I am Volg-Akhon-Urath. Newborn Fleshcrafter of House-Clan Volg, and servant of Rangda Rising&quot;</p><p>Electrical pulses exchanged between the Stream and Urath and after a moment knowledge both fresh and ancient entered the newborn&apos;s mind and it got to work crafting weapons of war to help consume the next world and complete the Great Weaving.</p><p>Months later once the population of Minish was fully consumed and its biosphere fully tainted the Conquering Worms titanic maw would open wide and bite a hole into the Warp. Like a parasite crawling into an open wound, the Hive sized Worm wriggled into the Warp and onto the next world ready to add itself to the glory of Rangda Rising.</p><p>A.N. Normally I am not a big fan of the unreliable Narrator idea but it is HEAVILY used in this section. Rangdan history is a mixture of fact, propaganda, brainwashing, missing half the information and missing knowledge filled in with myth. The Stance I am taking is the War In Heaven was such a nightmarish clusterfuck it pulled an Elder Scrolls and &quot;Broke the Dragon&quot; (Google it if you don&apos;t get the reference) and screwed time, reality, and the warp so utterly that all accounts of it are equally false and true.</p><p>So yeah maybe the Rangdans were used to create Nurgle and there is a fickle Anti-Tyranid with the personality of a histrionic art student or maybe they are a species of self-deluding parasites relying on faulty genetic memory to propagate a religious creed that mixes the Imperial Creeds zealotry with the Tyranids foreign policy.</p><p>Part IV Lunar Whisper</p><p>Location: The Forgotten Laboratories of Luna.</p><p>Date: Seven months after the Emperor left Terra.</p><p>Sagitari 17 was a Slave, his fate was not his own to decide. It had been decided for him decades before his birth. Existence was servitude under the most dangerous tyrant humanity had ever faced. Despots, totalitarians, and conquerors were common throughout human history but the one that had enslaved Sagitari 17&apos;s people and world was unique in that his tyranny was eternal.</p><p>The Immortal Emperor of Mankind was truly that and if his ambition was not stopped humanity would suffer under that abominations yoke for eternity. Sagitari had been raised hearing the tales of the Emperor&apos;s conquest of his home. How the noble Helix-Beasts and Cyber-Knights had been crushed by the rampaging Thunder Legions.</p><p>The Gene-Cults of Luna had exchanged one tyrant for another. The insane era of Cardinal Tang may have ended but the Selenar had their faith taken from them, their secrets looted and their skills press-ganged into creating instruments of galactic domination.</p><p>Some more liberal Selenar Matriarchs had eventually led their sects into the Emperor&apos;s enslavement, viewing him as the perfect embodiment of humanities genetic potential and the monsters he sought to grow the truest incarnates of humanities genetic archetypes. They were fools.</p><p>One had only to watch the Flesh-Harvests of the Astartes to know what a monster the Emperor was. Sagitari 17 was a particularly talented Gene-wright and forced to work on the Astartes Legions. He had witnessed thousands of young boys freshly stolen from their homes after testing positive for Astartes compatibility.</p><p>They were herded into the Gene-Seed processing centers like human livestock. The range of attitudes, origin, and attributes was remarkable. Scions of noble houses raised their head-height, proud of their selection. Juvenile monsters plucked from the worst hives strained against restraints and watched the shock-pole armed guards for any weakness.</p><p>Of all of them, Sagitari 17 pitied the Chthonians, plucked from their homeworld the gang-brats knew nothing of the fate awaiting them and feared the worse. Like cornered animals, the children of tunnel gangs and ruin-tribes gathered together and plotted escape futility.</p><p>Sagitari had always known he was a slave, his sect had sought to stand against The Emperor even after the First Pacification. Despite their beliefs and radical tendencies, they had played the loyal pet to the tyrant. The Matriarchs were divided on when and how to strike but all agreed now they must serve to survive. So despite knowing the truth his sibling-sects willing blinded themselves to Sagitari 17 had been a loyal and protective servant of the Imperium until the dreams started.</p><p>At first, they were faint things, barely remembered whispers when he awoke from a hibernation cycle soaked in cold sweat. Yet steadily once the news of the Emperors departure reached Luna they increased. By the end of the first month, he could fully remember the nightmarish hellscapes shown to him.</p><p>A Corpse Kingdom where thousands were fed to the Immortal Tyrant to sustain him. Where the sons he had grown within Luna itself rampaged across the stars, eternally seeking war and conquest. Just as their biological programming demanded. This dream, no vision of events that could be showed the eternity of the cruelest, bloodiest regime in human history that he was helping build.</p><p>By the end of the second month, the dreams were replaced with new visions. Of ancient patrons returning to guide humanity once again. Four Gods for the Moons Four Phases. They whispered secrets and hidden truths to him day and night. Knowledge forbidden by the Tyrant and lost to time filled his mind. Following the whispers, deep into ancient chambers in Lunar bedrock, he met others like him.</p><p>They were chosen, sacred, selected from the greatest Genetic-Lineages that kept to the old ways. Those who recognized the Imperial Truth as a lie and compliance as slavery. Together they combined occult practices half-remembered by their elders and things pulled from their dreams. Hidden far from the Eyes of the Emperor and as close to the whispers source as possible the rituals started.</p><p>Communing with the Four Patrons they reached the Dark-Side of the Reality and were told impossible truths. How the aspects of humanity worshiped by the Cults were just shards of the four-faced whole. Warrior, Farmer, Performer, Learner: The four faces of humanity. The Emperor&apos;s tyranny threatened even them. The Warlord planned to devour the aspects and remake humanity in his horrid image.</p><p>To achieve this insidious goal Twenty Aspects of Humanity were stolen from the Four and imprisoned in Flesh crafted using the finest of both Terran and Lunar lore. The Primarchs were not the Emperor&apos;s children, they were stolen from the four. Sagitaris 17 had wept tears of blood when he saw/felt/smelled/touched/remembered the Tyrants kidnaping of the twenty on the World Named Sacrifice.</p><p>The Four wanted to do what they had always done, guide humanity to greater heights in hopes they would reach the pantheon and truly embody the aspects. In order to do this, they needed to save their children stolen by the Emperor. This most blessed task was meant for Sagitari 17 and his fellow Chosen kin.</p><p>By the end of the third-month plans were being hatched. Family, sect members, and other open minds had the truth shown to them. The small coven grew with each convert and those unwilling to see the light where dealt with. Soon the hidden chambers that once held a dozen blessed Selenarians now was packed with hundreds of zealots eager to serve the Four Aspects of Humanity.</p><p>Unifying the wills of the worshipers and the power of unwilling sacrifices the Realm of Aspects were touched and knowledge poured forth. Knowledge of how to save the Stolen Children and their children born of mutated youths. The Primarchs may be beyond their reach but the Astartes were not.</p><p>The first step in this plan was to reach the place where it had all began. The Place of the Primarchs creation. In that deep forgotten and abandoned laboratory, a crack in time could be opened up. It would take months of preparation and manipulation to reach the sacred source of the whispers.</p><p>Across Luna, the whispers had spoken to other Elect like Sagitari 17 and formed cults much like his own. Together they found each other and formed the Creed of the Four Phases. By the end of the sixth month, hundreds of thousands across Luna were illuminated and ready to save humanity from eternal slavery. Entire Sects and Lab-Habs were indoctrinated. With each new addition, the power of the Creed grew and the secret buried below became just that closer.</p><p>Security was swapped with loyal members, technicians whispered prayers to the four as they installed backdoors both physical and electronic into the Forbidden Labs near Luna&apos;s north pole. They had been abandoned abruptly a decade or two ago, with all equipment dismantled and installed within the growing Palace.</p><p>As such little remained worth defending and it was easy enough to convince the Adepts in charge of Luna that security was better needed elsewhere to deal with the threats posed by numerous cult activities and escaped specimen. The specimen had been released for this purpose and the cults were rival organizations that existed in the shadows while not following the four.</p><p>By the seventh month Sagitari, his fellow Elect and a squad of specially grown Gene-Warriors had snuck deep into the Lunar Fortress. The plan was working perfectly. Sagitari 17 prayed silent thankful prayers to the Four the entire journey. Sneaking through maintenance shafts, and side passages they crept deeper and deeper into the hidden laboratory where twenty stolen children were given flesh.</p><p>Sagitari 17 had not been born with a particularly powerful connection to the Immaterium but his contact with the Aspects had strengthened the connection. Even so, he on some level though even a psychic blunt would be able to feel what was below him. The whispers were growing in intensity but they were not the only thing echoing through the realm of aspects.</p><p>It was a choir, a faint haunting choir of voices singing in unison. With each descended kilometer the choir increased in volume and clarity. Until finally as they reached the inner labs the horrible truth could be discerned. The choir was composed of thousands of screams.</p><p>After multiple days of crawling through the lab&apos;s bowls, they had made it to the holy of holies. Where the Four had attempted and failed to rescue their children. The screaming and whispers continued to increase with every step as the devout journeyed into the central chamber.</p><p>At the end of a dark ghostly hallway stood a great gate. Something in a language Sagitari could not read was carved into it. The inscription was circled by twenty haloed numerals and the psychic signals had reached migraine inducing heights. They had arrived.</p><p>Stolen Melta Charges were attached as Security Backdoors were activated. Confident that no alarms would be triggered the Gates&apos; joints were burned away. Slowly, groaning like an injured giant the gate came crashing down. Immediately the psychic pressure intensified, wards and incantations placed both before and after the Primarchs removal were broken.</p><p>The group could just as much feel as see what lay at the chambers far end. Past twenty empty plinths where gestation capsules once stood and empty grooves where esoteric machinery had sat was a tear. A Tear in time and space taller than any man and a dozen centimeters wide at its maximum.</p><p>Constant never ending truths and secrets poured from the rip in a psychic stream that engulfed the group. Sagitari 17 could see the crack straining to open up wider and he felt a subconscious shiver run up his spine when he saw what prevented the Four-Aspects Gate from opening. Chains/Thread/Spells woven of fire and a sacrificed choir lashed the portal shut.</p><p>Like a twisted parody of a suture, the Emperor&apos;s power had kept the gate close, but the power of the Four was greater than the tyrants. The chains were stretched taut and the full power of the Pantheon pushed them to their absolute limits. All it would take was one last push to break the seal on salvation open.</p><p>The rituals and technological secrets possessed by the Creed of the Four Phases had been poured into the creation of two artifacts crucial in their plans. The first, which Sagitari carefully removed from his pack and unwrapped from its Lowa-Silk dressing was a knife.</p><p>Its blade was formed from volcanic glass that seemed to drink light in instead of reflecting like it should. The handle was golden and decorated with precious gems. Great expense had gone into buying this artifact from a wealthy Hy Brasil Antiquities dealer. The blade was one of the few items on Terra traceable to an impossible ancient civilization.</p><p>Three things were known about this near-mythical civilization. Human sacrifice was a central focus of its religion, blades like the one in Sagitari&apos;s grip were used in those rituals. The civilization collapsed when another empire crushed it through Guns, Germs, Steel, and Cruelty.</p><p>The psychic resonance of this blade that had claimed hundreds of thousands of sacrificial victims millennia ago was reborn with new sacrifices in the Creeds name. Enemies and dissenters were fed to the knife in order to grant it the myth-symbolism it needed to break the seal.</p><p>Whispered prayers were chanted as Sagitari approached the gate. He could feel the weight of destiny on him and if had been not genetically altered not too he would have been soaked in nervous sweat. Holding the Sacred Blade in hands made steady by years of surgical practice he raised it up and prepared to cut the Emperor&apos;s shackles. The truth had been shown to him countless times, a final push upon the binds and he would finally be free!</p><p>Just as he was a meter away from the gate the distinct hiss of a Stasis-Chamber depressurizing filled the dark room. The Creeds Elect froze in shock. For all their planning and influence both supernatural and otherwise one contingency had escaped them. The one left by the Emperor and his right hand.</p><p>Culuxus Eta&apos;s eyes snapped open as his stasis chamber opened. The proto-Assassin knew he would only awaken if his tomb was disturbed. The Grand Master had left him hidden away in this secret chamber to protect it, now the time had come to fulfill his duty.</p><p>Soul-Crushing dread filled the Elects souls, none of them had ever encountered anything remotely like what had just sprung from a stasis chamber hidden in the room&apos;s wall. All they knew was it felt utterly horribly wrong and it was killing them.</p><p>Sagitari 17 could only watch in mute horror as the black-clad thing ripped his bodyguards apart. Centuries of Lunar Gene-Lore did nothing to help the Warriors as their very souls were ripped from their bodies by the Skull-headed abomination.</p><p>Calypsis-2, a fellow elect who showed talent in the aspect of the Warp-Weaver summoned Lighting to strike the monster down. It fizzled to nothing as the thing tore her heart out while feasting on her soul. Calypsis-2&apos;s last gurgled words were &quot;Complete the Ritu-&quot;</p><p>Pulling himself out his stupor Sagitari turned to the gate, he felt like his movements were in slow motion as the unleashed monster charged him. The remaining elect could only throw themselves into its path to buy him time.</p><p>Sagitari did not see the thing snap the last bodyguard&apos;s neck, nor it feast on a curse or its caster. He could only stare into the abyss as the Obsidian Blade fulfilled its destiny and cut the seal. The Chamber was painfully silent for a moment as both psychic whispers and screams stopped. Then the Tyrants seal exploded in a shower of molten ectoplasm.</p><p>Eta pushed his gene-strengthened body to its limits as he fought to reach the rip. For the rest of his short existence, he would curse his failure. The Seal was broken and while he did not know it Eta for once had reason to be thankful for his pariah nature. For his mind did not echo with the Laughter of Thirsting Gods that poured from the Rip.</p><p>For a split second, Sagitari wondered if he had made a terrible mistake as the insane raucous laughter echoed through the chamber. The split second doubt was cast aside as he started into the widening Crack in reality. What he saw was beautiful and terrible beyond words. The full glory/horror of the warp was laid out before him.</p><p>Enchantments and genetic failsafes protected him from the madness that would have claimed any unprotected mortal. Yet his mind almost collapsed when he saw the face looking back at him through the now-portal. A twisted black Daemonic visage grinned at him. It was a face a thousand cultures had given to their Archfiends. The Crown Prince of Damnation let a cruel chuckle escape between his fangs before he reached out into the Materium.</p><p>The last thing First Generation Culuxus Operative Eta saw was a gigantic clawed hand reach out of the Crack. His nature let him see the true form of the Monster. The armor and flesh of countless hosts were soldered together into a classical supernatural shape that oozed black Warp-Vapor.</p><p>It moved at literally inhuman speeds and grabbed the Assassins head. Even with the oversized helm it barely filled the things, palm. Eta screamed in pain as it slowly crushed him, desperately the Pariah absorbed entire Lesser Neverborn worth of energy off the monster with no effect. In his last painfilled moments Eta realized his power to siphon warp-power was simply not enough. He was just a mortal and could never hope to stand against the Firstborn of the Warp.</p><p>The Fear and dread inspired by the Skull-headed thing disappeared when its head was reduced to a thin paste in the new monster&apos;s claws. The sheer panic the thing inspired more than replaced it. The Monster almost lazily pulled itself fully out of the portal. It crouched down to fit in the six-meter tall chamber. Great black wings stretched and retracted as its horned head swung around the chamber observing the three surviving Elect.</p><p>In a voice both physical and psychic that rattled Sagitaris bones, it spoke calmly: &quot;I am Bel&apos;akor: The Dark Master. Kneel before me mortals and be rewarded for your efforts&quot;</p><p>Shakily the three knelt before the monster and awaited their fate. Sagitari looked away from the creature, it was painful to look at. Its very presence seemed to taint reality. When-ever he dared to sneak a glance he felt nauseated. When it moved it was like the universe needed a moment to processes the action, and could not fully translate what it did. The laws of physics were weakened by its very presence.</p><p>The Psychic effect was similarly horrible. It was like a like a Dark-Star burning with malice and cruel intellect was drawing his soul into its gravitational pull and searing patterns of evil and insanity into his very being.</p><p>&quot;The second item? Do you have it?&quot; the monster growled.</p><p>Nervously Sagitari 17&apos;s only equal on the mission Pelia 7 removed the item from her pack. While his had been purchased and consecrated hers had been crafted and imbued with power. It appeared a simple Goblet carved from Granite and inlaid with rubies. In truth, it was one of the most complicated items ever crafted on Luna.</p><p>Using warpborn knowledge and the Genetic Mastery of the Selenar this artifact could be used to create virtually infinite amounts of biological matter, even that touched by the warp. Pelia 7 lifted the chalice up towards Bel&apos;akor. The First Prince pricked his palm with a claw and allowed a few drops of jet black blood fall into the goblet.</p><p>With cruel expectant eyes, he watched them and spoke: &quot;Now the final part of the ritual.&quot;</p><p>The Grail could duplicate anything, even the Aspect Incarnate before thems blood, for a price. It needed a similar enough substance to overwrite. Sagitari grabbed the third survivor and held her neck above the grail. Praying softly he slit the panicking women&apos;s throat and it poured into the goblet. When it touched Bel&apos;akors blood it instantly turned as black as his.</p><p>Soon the goblet was filled and the women&apos;s body slumped to the ground. Smiling the Aspect Incarnate moved back towards the portal and spoke. &quot;Continue the destiny the Four have picked for you, poison the Legions with my blood and prepare for the promised day. My power has filled this chamber and the Anathema will not be able to tell what has occurred here unless he gets too close.&quot;</p><p>Like a great Draconic Serpent, The Dark Prince of Chaos slithered back through the portal with a final warning &quot;Do not disappoint us, there is much at stake and the war has not even begun.&quot;</p><p>With that, the monster that would haunt the two survivors minds for the rest of their existence faded back into the Immaterium. The Crack shrunk and they stood in silence. Sagitari knew the atrocities he had committed were just the start of many, but he also knew any price was worth freeing his people from the Emperor&apos;s shackles. Much had to be done to prepare for the promised day and he would show the Four his devotion and that humanity was worthy of them.</p>
