<p>Chapter Sixteen: The Court of Destiny</p><p>Location: The Bucephalus, currently in Martian Orbit.<br>Date: 792.M31 (Approximately six Terran Months since the signing of the Treaty of Olympus)</p><p>The Emperor of Mankind stood aboard the Bucephalus observatories and gazed out into the void. The Red Planet in all its glory filled the viewport and his superhuman eyes studied the worlds intricate surface. Continent-sized industrial centers and Forges the size of countries marked the rust-colored world. In many ways, the planet was much like its inhabitants. A survivor of countless cataclysms both Man-made and natural, that had been augmented and changed by machinery and metal to better survive the Galaxy.</p><p>Each of Nation-States known to Mars as Forges had sworn loyalty to him. Now the full manufacturing capacity of the Crimson Jewel of Sol was put to work in the Imperiums War Machine. Armor, Weapons, Vehicles, Infrastructure, and Voidships were being churned out in astonishing numbers.</p><p>A few days ago he had presided over the Keel Laying of the first Imperial Battleship to be built at the Ring of Iron. The utterly massive super-structure was mass producing Warships and support craft as fast as it could. Entire Asteroids had been dragged from the Nearby belt and fed to the ravenous Forges of Mars.</p><p>Martian STC&apos;s, Terran relics and some of the Emperors own knowledge combined to create new tools of conquest. Knowledge of the distant past and the Grim Dark Future had been gifted to Mars as part of the Treaty. While restricted by a lack of certain exotic resources and a few other factors this Great Crusade would start better equipped.</p><p>The current standard issue Power Armor was known as Mk II Legio Armor. It actually had morin common with the God-Emperor&apos;s timelines mk III and mk IV in appearance and capabilities. Tactical Dreadnought Armor was also slated for production but awaiting a larger supply of Adamantium to be mass produced. Every scrap of the nearly indestructible metal was being used in the growing Imperial Fleet.</p><p>Yet despite there unparalleled contribution to the War effort and powerful role in the Imperium elements of the Tech-Clergy were still distrustful. In the God-Emperors time this distrust had become disloyalty. This could not be tolerated and the Emperor intended to end this issue before it ever became a threat to Imperial stability.</p><p>This was not the only such situation where the possible future actions of people or organizations were a concern to the Emperor and his inner circle. He had at first ordered Malcador and his pet Assassins (which he was technically not supposed to know about) to hunt down and eliminate the most flagrant and destructive of these individuals decades before the events they would be involved with ever occurred. These pawns both willing and unwitting of Chaos had been obscured from his foresight by the Four. Now such protection was useless and they were subject to the Emperor&apos;s machinations.</p><p>While the list had shrunk with each passing week as the Masters of each Assassin Clade and their disciples conducted their grim work. Malcador and the Emperor were still stuck with a sizable chunk of individuals whose fate was not set in stone. In the Grimdarkness they had been enemies, yet if handled correctly they could help humanity walk the Shining Path. Even individuals who had not been hidden from his view could possibly be redeemed if they were careful.</p><p>To this effort Malcador, Uriah and the Emperor had assembled a group of Philosophers, Precognitive Psykers, and Lawbringers to access these men and women of uncertain fate. Their duty was to guide those of uncertain fate into the light and eliminate them if that was not possible.</p><p>Knowing the dangers of such a practice running wild a large part of this organization&apos;s duties was to ensure no other options were available and eliminations were done in an ethical way. Even if a person was headed down a path of darkness they had not committed the crimes they were being executed for yet. This new and highly secretive branch of Imperial Justice was known to the scant few privy to its existence as the Court of Destiny. A place where future actions and possible fates were judged.</p><p>Its branches included a conclave of Telepaths and Precogs who researched and mapped out the minds and futures of the Judged. The Philosophers and Lawbringers debated the ethics and necessity of their actions. A group of Adepts under Malcador scattered throughout Imperial government and military were used to push the Judged along a better path. Nearly all of the newly made Chaplaincy core of the Astartes had connections to this group. Finally, those who could not be redeemed and were utterly Damned were referred to the Assassinorum.</p><p>Today the Emperor intended to do something atypical, he was going to directly intervene and handle one of these Judged himself. This would be the fourth time he had personally tried to push a Judged onto the path of becoming what the Court called a Fatebreaker. Someone who freed themselves from the twisted path the Four had laid out for them.</p><p>If he succeeded any Martian insurrection would be crippled before it could gestate. If not&#x2026; well, others messier options were more available. So here in the final weeks of his stay at Mars, he had sent a message down to the Fabricator General. Asking for a particularly talented rising star of the priesthood to be sent aboard the Bucephalus.</p><p>The meeting was due to take place within a few hours and he could already see one of the distinct shuttle craft of the Custodes peeling away from the intense orbital traffic and heading to dock with its mothership. Aboard it was the Judged who had been subject to the intense scrutiny of his bodyguards before he was allowed anywhere near the Emperor.</p><p>He could sense the Three Custodes aboard the craft and its passenger. The Emperor was slightly amused how hard the Judged was attempting to quash the overwhelming dread and fear filling what was left of his organic brain. Transhuman Dread as the Legions were starting to call it had long been a side effect of humanities various attempts to enhance its warriors.</p><p>The Psychic aspects of the Astartes and Custodes creation further enhanced the effect to new levels. At first, the Emperor had attempted to eliminate the effect, he found the idea of humanities Protectors causing mind breaking fear in their charges and being examples of what ancient Terran cyberneticists called the uncanny valley distasteful. Eventually, he realized this flaw could become a feature with a little tweaking.</p><p>Astartes and Custodes by nature are psychic beings, each altered not just on a biological but spiritual level by their augments. Granting a level of the supernatural abilities possessed by their Gene-Sire. this was the reason the experiments in Pariah gene Astartes conducted by his alternate self-had failed so disastrously.</p><p>It had taken a bit psychic engineering but the Imperiums transhuman champions inspired more shock and awe than dread and horror in those who viewed them. This effect was derived from the psychic charisma of both him and his sons. It was not enough to fully eliminate the dread but alter it enough to be useful. As an added bonus this effect had been tied into the connection they shared with him. If that connection was broken by Xeno or Warp taint the sheer wrongness of the augmented being would be unfiltered and provide a measure of defense and easy identification of these fallen.</p><p>The Emperor had seen quite viscerally how far an Astartes could fall. Even now he could see the Favored Son of a Favored Son putting the galaxy to the torch while wielding two the very few weapons in existence capable of tasting his blood. That ancient monster who would break Arcadia and despoil so much of the already rotting Imperium would be born in a few years, he also would need to be judged by the Court.</p><p>The Shuttle docked within the cavernous hangers of his flagship and he could feel the flickering ember that was his terrified guest&apos;s soul move slowly towards him through the massive vessel.</p><p>The Emperor was clothed in a uniform that mixed elements of military dress garb and Terran Nobility fashion. His form and clothing could be changed with a thought, either through manipulation of matter or minds. He often found it interesting how his dress added a form of filter to his power and radiance. In the plain robes of ancient Terran tribes, he was a prophet, a messiah. In the armor and uniforms of battle a conquering God-King. Today he was to an extent both. The Omnissiah of Mars and the Emperor of Terra.</p><p>The Observatory was one of the odder locations upon the Bucephalus. It served no practical purpose and a defense turret would be a better use of the space upon the ships hull. Even so, the Emperor wanted his flagship to be more than a vessel of War. It would be a beacon of unity and progress. A center of diplomacy and civilization as much a tool of conquest.</p><p>He could see it now, in a few decades dignitaries from dozens of newly unified worlds would dine and forge bonds of brotherhood under the translucent dome that allowed starlight to illuminate the chamber. The Emperor knew much blood would need to be shed to unify the human species, he was under no such illusions that many worlds would rather die than submit. That being true there would still be even more meetings that would reunite humanity, not as rival powers but long-lost siblings.</p><p>As his musing shifted to plans for the future the Cognatu Ferrum chirped psychically that his guest was about to arrive. Thanking the loyal machine he pulsed permission for the Custodes to bring the tech-priest into the chamber. Great synth-wood doors creaked open and the illumination of the vessels passages spilled into the Observatory. Filling the room with more light than the meager amount provided by the stars and reflected from the Martian Surface.</p><p>The heavy footfalls of the Custodes and the slight mechanical whir of their charge entered the Chamber. The Emperor had to hide a smirk at that, the Custodes even armored head to toe in advanced Power Armor could be completely silent yet choose not to be in situations like this. It was an intimidation tactic of course. A useful tool for a bodyguard yet wasted on the guest. His fear poured off his soul like a putrid storm and the Emperor doubted little the Custodes could do would increase it.</p><p>The Emperor of Mankind turned away from the view of Mars once they were a few meters away. Surrounded by a trinity of Custodes was a disheveled and terrified Cyborg. He admired how hard the man tried to hide his fear but any sane being in his predicament would be as fearful as he was.</p><p>The man before him was young by Martian standards and extraordinarily talented. He was only a few decades old and only maybe another away from becoming a Magos. The Tech-Priest was part of a not insignificant minority that viewed the Treaty of Mars as a conquest through words. An act they saw as a violation of the Mechanicum which stole their autonomy and not a treaty at all but a contract between master and servant forced to be signed at weapon-point. The Tech-Priest and his minority saw the Emperor as a heretical imposter. Some monster born of Archeotech or Xeno science, not the Omnissiah.</p><p>In another light, the Emperor would find all of this darkly amusing. A group of fanatics who would rather have the freedom and tools to doom themselves to nightmarish ends then work for humanities survival. They were technically correct though, he had subjected Mars and was not the &quot;true&quot; Omnissiah. Such a being did not exist and he had the best claim for the title. People always seemed to favor the immediate and the foolish.</p><p>The Emperor watched the frightened Tech-Priest looked into his augmented eyes. For a moment the Emperor let his aura leak out. His eyes turned from deep brown to golden flaming orbs. A Halo of fire and light erupted around him and the Tech-Priest collapsed to his knees in a mix of shock and reverence. Speaking calmly he addressed the Martian.</p><p>&quot;Kelbor-Hal; I have wanted to speak to you for some time.&quot;</p><p>Kelbor-Hal seemed to freeze for a moment as if he was not processing what was being said. Then the shock wore off and the blade-sharp intellect of the once-future Fabricator General sprung into action. A keen political mind was as necessary if not more so than technical aptitude to rise through the Ranks of the Mechanicum. That keen political instinct kicked in almost instantly as Hal collected himself.</p><p>The crackle of synthetic voice filled the Observatory as Kelbor-Hal addressed the Emperor: &quot;It is beyond an honor to be in your presence oh Omnissiah. Whatever you require of me I shall do. I am your servant and willing cog in whatever you wish.&quot;</p><p>Kelbor-Hal rose from the near collapsed state to a respectful kneel. His mechadendrites were folded in a posture indicating submission and respect among the Mechanicum. Hal knew how to hide his emotions and intent well and play the willing supplicant. It seemed another display of power was in order.</p><p>Turning away from the kneeling Tech-Priest the Emperor gazed out at Mars, as he did his mind touched the Martian Population. With the ease, a mortal would have reading a news-periodical the Emperor of Mankind read every single mind on the Red Planet. None of the Martian noticed. The only evidence of this act was faint fluctuations in the Warp only the most sensitive would feel.</p><p>Turning back to Kelbor-Hal he spoke as his eyes glowed with Psychic-Fire. &quot;There are currently 13,141,592,653 living humans on Mars. that does not count Servitors and other lobotomized or partial-sentients of human origin. 4,981,196,225 of those humans to varying degrees believe I am a false-omnissiah and that the Treaty is conquest just by another name.&quot;</p><p>The Tech-Priest seemed confused until the horrific realization struck as the Emperor continued. &quot;I know this because I am reading the minds of all Thirteen billion of them. This is an easy task for me. In fact, reading the minds of every human within the Solar System is well within my capabilities. I tell you this so you know lying or trying to obscure your true feelings is a pointless endeavor.&quot;</p><p>It was like a puppet&apos;s strings had been cut. Kelbor-Hal&apos;s body went limp as the truth and horrific power of the being before him crashed into his mind like an ocean swell. Slowly clambering to his feet the Tech-Priest marshaled every ounce of willpower and blurted out a simple message in binary. &quot;I do not know what Heretekal experiments spawned you. I know I am but a mote of dust compared to the forces you wield, but I will do everything I can to protect Mars from you.&quot;</p><p>Kelbor-Hal expected to be atomized on the spot, turned to nothing but ash by the false-god before him. In fact, that was the fate he hoped for. Better death than being enslaved to help craft weapons and tools of butchery for this Gene-wrought monster. Or worse yet being used as material by whatever Fleshcrafter made the Golden Giants that flanked him. He never expected the Psi-Abomination that had enslaved his people to congratulate him, let alone in perfect binary.</p><p>&quot;Kelbor-Hal you have exceeded my expectations. Instead of pleading or attempting to escape your seeming fate. You were prepared to die for your ideals, even if they were misguided. Throughout my long life, I&apos;ve learned a man willing to die for the wrong cause is worth a hundred ones feigning loyalty to a noble one. For a committed man can be shifted to serve a good cause as rigorously if not more so than he did the first. &quot;</p><p>It was impossible for an unaugmented human throat to produce the Binaric Cant spoken by Martians. Yet through some act of superhuman ability, the Emperor had spoken the Machine tongue. The entire world view and knowledge of what was possible of Kelbor-Hal was being pulled apart.</p><p>Reverting back to Gothic the Emperor continued: &quot;I know you fear the worst from me, and my existence seems impossible. Little I can say will convince you of the truth of my being and intentions so I must ask you a simple question. What would you do to ensure the survival of Mars and the human species?&quot;</p><p>Kelbor answered almost immediately &quot;Anything, I would do anything to protect Mars and its people.&quot;</p><p>A slight smile crossed the Emperor perfect features as he replied: &quot;That will be put to the test. The Binary language is based on the most basic of concepts. One or Zero, yes or no. It&apos;s very fitting that Mars fate is based upon a similar question. Kelbor-Hal you are the one who will choose. Yes or no, will Mars survive and thrive or be ripped apart by strife and Chaos.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I have a request of you if you answer yes Mars fate as part of the Imperium will be sealed and humanities future will be secure. If you answer no then you will set forth a chain of events that end with Mars being ripped apart in civil war and the Mechanicum being destroyed.&quot;</p><p>The Tech-Priests fists and Mechadendrites clenched with anger as he responded. &quot;Is that a threat? If I do not serve you will destroy all I hold dear?&quot;</p><p>Sadness filled the Emperor eyes: &quot;No I will not destroy the Mechanicum, you will. The blood of innocence will be on your hands and Mars will burn under your command.&quot;</p><p>Before Kelbor-Hal could reply visions of possible futures and memories of the God-Emperor poured into his augmented brain. Heresy, horror, and betrayal filled the young Cyborgs mind.</p><p>Twitching slightly the increasingly disturbed Tech-Priest spoke: &quot;Why do you show me such things? Your trickery and lies will not work. You are not the Omnissiah!&quot;</p><p>&quot;You are correct and incorrect. I am one of the two beings closest to the entity you call the Machine God. Except I am not its incarnate nor spawn. I am its master and jailer. Would you like to meet the Deus Mechanicus? If you accept my offer you will.&quot; responded the Emperor.</p><p>Sputtering softly Kelbor-Hal replied: &quot;What madness is this? The Machine God is not something that could be contained or dominated...</p><p>&quot;The mythological being you worship could never be sealed or controlled, true. The being that inspired the myths? That is a very different story.&quot; A wry smile crossed the Emperor face at that.</p><p>Sighing softly to himself the Emperor continued: &quot;I know I will not be able to convince you to do this of your own free will and could only force you or compel you to. That is not my wish, I want you to do this of your own volition. So I will offer you another option. Journey to the place of my request and meet with the other being who could be called Omnissiah. Gain knowledge and evidence I can not provide you without upsetting future events. After meeting with him you can accept my request or deny it and take the knowledge you have gained and spread it throughout Mars.&quot;</p><p>Warrely the Tech-Priest asked: &quot;Tell me this request and I might consider this.&quot;</p><p>The pull of lost and forbidden knowledge was great on any member of the Mechanicum but practically and addictive hunger for its members like Kelbor-Hal. The Emperor, of course, knew this and while he needed this choice to be Hal&apos;s he could, of course, influence it in his favor.</p><p>&quot;To study under the Guardian of the Noctis Labyrinth and once his successor is chosen, guide her until she is ready to fulfill his responsibilities. After that, you can use whatever knowledge you have gained however you wish.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The Noctis Labyrinth? Nothing sane or human lives there. What could possibly be of any importance be located in that pit of decay and contamination?&quot; : Asked Hal.</p><p>&quot;If you journey their you will find out for yourself.&quot; was all the Emperor said in reply. At that Kelbor-Hal was escorted from the Observatory and the Bucephalus.</p><p>The once possible Fabricator General did not know what decision he would make but the Emperor did. The tides of destiny shifted and he could watch the future. How after a few weeks of internal anguish Kelbor-hal would journey to the Noctis Labyrinth and meet his god. Seymon would glad to have the company and this would set the Mechanicum down a very different path.</p><p>Without the Primarchs rebelling and the intellectual and political lynchpin of Kelbor-Hal Mars would never rebel. Or at least any attempts would be far too crippled to have any major effects. In turn after a few centuries, Hal would emerge as a wise Sage and start to preach a new creed to the Martians. One that championed human ascendancy instead of machine worship, and careful development of technology as opposed to relic hunting pseudo-luddism.</p><p>Another threat eliminated by turning it into an asset. He would have to inform the Court of Destiny when he sent his weekly communique to Terra. Thoughts of his and humanities homeworld turned to his children. Despite the strange perception of time gained by immortality, he knew he had been away too long and he missed his sons. Thankfully within another month or so he would return to Terra and the Primarchs.</p><p>Location: The Outer Palace<br>Date: 793.M31</p><p>The Emperor&apos;s return was met with grand fanfare. Festivals were held across humanities homeworld. Pict-casts of the Emperor&apos;s speech announcing the Treaty of Mars were shown in every settlement. From sprawling hives to barren junk-towns the Master of Mankind words brought joy to the people. Unification was coming and soon humanity would never need to fear the darkness.</p><p>Thousands of Tech-Priests and Mechanicum officials had arrived on board both the Bucephalus and the veritable fleet of Martian ships that had jocked for the honor of being part of the Omnissiah honor-guard and to work on his most holy tasks. Soon stalled projects and sluggishly developing infrastructure had the minds and augments of Martian Priests to guide the throngs of Terran labor.</p><p>Terrawatt Clan elders and Martian Magos&apos;s exchanged knowledge and were overjoyed to meet their like-minded kin from across the void. Terran nobles met with the strange Mechanical-Men from Mars and political pacts and trade agreements were drawn up as the two cultures realized the benefits they could provide each other.</p><p>The Emperor returned to his children and both father and sons rejoiced at their reunification. In the few years since his leaving the Primarchs had grown into strong youths. Not quite men yet but more than boys. Gifts crafted with supernatural intellect and acquired from Mars were exchanged. Stories of youth and adventure within the ever-growing palace along with brotherly boasting met the Emperors. He had forgotten the simple joys of being a parent in the long millennia since he last fathered children.</p><p>The Legions were also growing in number. Ten thousand years of the souls of Loyal Apothecaries and Magos Genetor&apos;s experience with creating new Astartes was put to good use. The Process had been refined and mastered to such a degree that with a compatible applicant rejection was virtually unheard of. Current estimates showed the Legions with larger candidate pools would reach nearly a hundred thousand Marines by the time they left Sol.</p><p>Sadly that estimate would not come true due to future events. The fallout from the brewing troubles on Luna would injure the infant Legions, but it would be a small price to pay for the events it would set in motion.</p><p>The Legions were already seeing the effects of the corruption among the new recruits. Resistance to Hypno-indoctrination, morale and discipline issues, seemingly random catastrophic Gene-Seed Rejections. This puzzling list of symptoms was the effect of the madness the Selenar cults had tainted the Gene-Seed with. This was only the beginning when the Cult struck countless horrors would be unleashed. Each Legion would be torn apart by chaotic corruption and insanity.</p><p>Instead of the fatal blow to the Imperium like the Ruinous Powers wished this calamity would be a crucible. The Legions, the Primarchs, and the Imperium would come away from it stronger and prepared to face the horrors of the galaxy. Of course, the Emperor left nothing to chance and countless contingencies were being prepared to ensure the optimal outcome.</p><p>The first few months of the Emperor&apos;s return were spent working on Terran-Martian integration along with some much overdue time with the Primarchs. It pleased him to see how much they were growing into fine young men. Showing the best of what they could be and thankfully little of the vainglorious Demi-Gods the God-Emperor dealt with.</p><p>So as time passed the Emperor acquired more time to work on his contingencies and other projects. By his own personal design the Emperor was rather uninvolved with Imperial governance, and only took an active role when it was absolutely required. While his role as Emperor of Mankind was far more involved and public than most of his masks from human history it while all the others were temporary. Humanity could not be allowed to become reliant on him.</p><p>The God-Emperor&apos;s memories had shown how effective and enduring the Imperial government was. Even when utterly crippled by dogma, paranoid ignorance and a never-ending tide of devastation it had survived and more or less thrived for ten thousand years. The Barbaric grimdark atrocity his ambitions had once been doomed to become was the longest lasting continuous civilization in human history. If guided correctly by his hand the Imperium and what came after it would survive and thrive for far far longer.</p><p>Some of the contingencies to ensure the Imperiums survival along with so many other secrets were located within a series of vaults deep within the Imperial Palace. These vaults and chambers were some of the most well protected and hidden sections of the sprawling megastructure. This Dungeon was home to the Emperor&apos;s laboratories. A complex filled with artifacts, equipment, and personnel selected to assist him in his endeavors.</p><p>The curious design of the Palace strangely allowed straight accesses from the Dungeons entrance to the Lion Gate. This, of course, was an effect of the Emperor&apos;s planning. Within a few centuries, the entirety of the labs content would be moved elsewhere and the space would become the nexus and heart of the Imperial Webway. For now, it was a subterranean domain of science and sorcery diligently working in secret for the Master of Mankind.</p><p>Today was one of the days he had an opportunity to journey to the Imperial Dungeon. A testy round of negotiations involving the Navis Nobility and Mechanicum had finished thanks in part to his arbitration. The Primarchs were away from the Palace leading Astartes sorties against the various filth and monsters that dwelled below the surface of Terra. Even as youths their mastery of strategy and command was virtually unparalleled. It was good practice for both them and the Legions while helping purify humanities home. So with the wheels of governance and parenting running smoothly, the Emperor could work on his projects.</p><p>This particular day the Emperor journeyed to the Gene-smithing and the flesh-crafting segment of the Labs. Here the lore and equipment used to create the Legions and Primarchs were stored along with countless other wonders. Here infants were reforged into his Custodes, secrets of the Golden Age were relearned and weapons to drive back the dark were created.</p><p>The Laboratory was kept separate and secret from the rest of the Imperium. It was a self-sufficient pocket of research and manufacturing complexes designed to ensure that no matter what the treaties with Mars or Lex Imperialis said the Emperor possessed his own private forge an army greater than any other. Secrets never to be divulged and resources never to be shared were put to good use providing the Emperor an edge over any threat to his ambition. Be they external monsters or internal strife.</p><p>Passing through the great blast doors into the Genelab the Emperor and his guards were greeted with bows and other marks of supplication by the researchers and gene-crafters. With a motion, he commanded the Laboratories staff to continue working. His intense Psychic Halo dimmed to tolerable levels. Enough to inspire awe and increase productivity through adoration but not enough turn the find minds witnessing it into blubbering sycophants. Learning to control his aura and its effects on mortals had been one of the first things the Shaman spirits had taught him.</p><p>The Gene-Labs were staffed by entire Selenar Clans and Terrawatt tech-lineages that had been transplanted to the secret realm of the Laboratories. Each had been selected and groomed for not only intellectual and technical skill but fanatical loyalty. The fools spreading worming corruption beneath Luna&apos;s surface were chaff, useful for mass producing the Legions but ultimately expendable. Yet another pawn to be sacrificed in his never-ending gambit.</p><p>Large sections of the Gene-labs were given over to the fantastically complicated apparatus needed to create Custodes. Each Astartes was a sword pointed at mankind&apos;s foes and created from twenty specialized molds. The Custodes instead were master-worked spears meant to guard the species future. Not pressed out of a mold but artfully created. Here in these labs the blueprints and designs penned by the Emperor were used to craft his personal Legion. In another time and era, those blueprints would have been reused for ten thousand years by the grieving Custodes to ensure replenish themselves. After all, any sufficiently talented smith could follow a genius&apos;s blueprints.</p><p>Other parts contained massive sequencer engines. Primitive but powerful devices designed to allow the mass organization of genetic codes. One of the more subtle and hidden parts of the Emperors Plan involved guiding humanities evolutionary path. With every unified world, another set of genes would be collected covertly and added to his Archives. These engines would compile and organize the data allowing a more accurate map of the countless variants of humanity. With time this information would be used to help cultivate the next generation of the species, and guide them down the shining path.</p><p>Yet neither of these wonders nor the countless others contained within the Genelab were the focus of the Emperors work today. That honor fell to the Labyrinth Vaults, an isolated segment of the Labs that contained the remains of the Primarch Project. They had not been locked away after the creation of the Legions like in the God Emperor&apos;s time for a desperate Raven to find. Instead, they continued the Great Work.</p><p>Entering the Lab he glanced down at the ornate tiles and whispered to himself the message transcribed in an ancient cipher upon the entrance halls floor.</p><p>&quot;In Egypt&apos;s sandy silence, all alone,</p><p>Stands a gigantic Leg, which far off throws</p><p>The only shadow that the Desert knows:&#x2014;</p><p>&quot;I am great OZYMANDIAS,&quot; saith the stone,</p><p>&quot;The King of Kings; this mighty City shows</p><p>&quot;The wonders of my hand.&quot;&#x2014; The City&apos;s gone,&#x2014;</p><p>Naught but the Leg remaining to disclose</p><p>The site of this forgotten Babylon.</p><p>We wonder,&#x2014;and some Hunter may express</p><p>Wonder like ours, when thro&apos; the wilderness</p><p>Where London stood, holding the Wolf in chace,</p><p>He meets some fragment huge, and stops to guess</p><p>What powerful but unrecorded race</p><p>Once dwelt in that annihilated place.&quot;</p><p>It was an ancient poem, one of two penned by friends of the Emperor. Both testaments to the fall of Empires and hubris. The Emperor had developed the habit of leaving such historical references and oddities in his trail millennia ago. It helped ground the ancient immortal and provide a trail of breadcrumbs for future historians to follow. A more wistful part of Revelation hoped in a future where humanity was prepared to survive the cosmos his saga could be told. Secrets and illusions had colored his existence out of sheer necessity and hopefully, one-day humanity would be ready to learn the epic truth of him and the species.</p><p>On another level, the nature of the poem was an attempt to apologize and recognize the Imperium for what it was. Despite its necessity, the Imperium of Man would be an authoritarian imperialistic feudal genocidal state. That truth never escaped the Emperor. If an evil must be committed to preserving humanity he would commit it. Any sin he would shoulder to protect his people from the darkness that sought their extinction. Hopefully, future generations would acknowledge it as the grim last chance of the species and forgive him and all those he had ordered to commit terrible crimes for the sake of survival.</p><p>Entering the Labyrinth Vaults proper the Emperor was greeted with the smell of growth-chemicals and the steady hum of maturation-vats. Here in the great chamber where the remnants of the Primarch Project had been repurposed was the single largest repository of Gene-seed that would ever exist.</p><p>Filling the chamber were hundreds of dozen meter tall growth racks. Each structure containing thousands upon thousands of progenoids glands. Row after row of plasti-glass storage vials held the rapidly maturing gene-seed. This collection contained enough progenoids to field tens of millions of Astartes. The Primarchs from infancy had been capable of producing an immense amount of Gene-seed and only a fraction of that had been sent to Luna for the creation of the Legions.</p><p>The only true limit to a Legions size when its Primarch was available to produce gene-seed was the number of applicants and military infrastructure. Thanks to the knowledge taken from the future applicants were plentiful and Mars provided all the Legions could need. Soon millions of Astartes would march under the Aquila. Bringing death to humanities enemies and safety to its scattered worlds.</p><p>The moment he entered the chamber his Psychic aura cascaded through it, alerting the staff of their master&apos;s presence. Instead of Selenar or other similar technicians, this laboratory was staffed by Astartes. The Legionaries who in a decade would form the beginning of the Apothecary corps had been handpicked to assist the creation of the Legions. Each had been selected from the intellectual elite of their legions recruitment districts. Two hundred of the finest young minds of Terra ready to serve and learn from the Emperor the secrets of the Astartes.</p><p>The Apothecaries who were on shift assembled and knelt before him. They were not much older than his own children. Recruited as teenagers instead of the youths common to the legions, they had been old enough to prove themselves worthy of this honor.</p><p>At his command, they rose. Each despite their repeated exposure and strong spirits were enthralled utterly by the Emperor&apos;s power. He was the Master of Mankind by his will alone and his gene-forged descendants knew that in their souls and embraced it. All except one, he resisted with every ounce of his being. Not out of disloyalty or spite. No, this Apothecary resisted because he was the most fanatically and devout of them all.</p><p>He was younger than his brethren, personally selected by the Emperor while touring the Ingolstadt Hive of the Jermanic Federation of Europa. His family had been a wealthy aristocratic clan of intellectuals and loyal subjects of the Imperium. Having the youngest son of the current Heir be chosen to become one of the Emperors Angels was the highest honor.</p><p>From there the child had survived the trials of augmentation intact. Iskandar&apos;s geneseed had proved highly compatible and he took to his training perfectly. Along with the 199 other Apothecaries he had studied under the elite of the Emperors genetics laboratories and even witnessed the Emperor himself at work. After that display only he had the gall to ask the Master of Mankind questions.</p><p>The Apothecary knew he would be penalized for his transgression by his superiors but desired to know the answer outweighed his distastes for punishment. The Emperor answered his question and then took him aside and answered every question the young astartes could ask. The knowledge shared had rattled the young warrior to the core while lighting a blaze of loyalty and desire to fulfill the Emperor&apos;s ambitions in his mind.</p><p>These events and most of the Apothecaries life had been in fact carefully orchestrated by the Court of Destiny and the Emperor himself. It had been both an experiment and test. An experiment to see if the terrible truths of the cosmos could be used in such a way to inspire loyalty and resolve. The Apothecary had been a resounding success he desired humanities salvation and attempted to resist the Emperor&apos;s power, as a way of trying to become more like the Master of Mankind&apos;s vision of humanity.</p><p>The test was to see if this once curious youth from Ingolstadt could break the fate the Prince of Pleasure had decreed for him. So far Apothecary Fabius of the III Legion had gone above and beyond the call of duty and was proving to possess the intellect and skills of his alternate self. While maintaining empathy and sanity keenly lacking in the manslayer.</p><p>Fabius had risen through the ranks of the Apothecary Corp to the title of Apothecarium Primus of the III Legion and Alumnus Augustus. He had studied under the Emperor and become a master of the arts of gene-forging and Astartes creation. The loyalty and skills he had shown earned him the place as Project Leader on the work the Emperor had arrived at the Lab to oversee.</p><p>After the initial greetings and updates on various project progress, the Emperor&apos;s Custodes and Fabius adjourned to a side chamber. Their information was exchanged and timetables were updated. They were unlike many aspects of the Crusade ahead of schedule. Batch after batch of the pure Gene-Seed was being produced. This was not the mutation-prone half finished augments of the God-Emperors warriors, this breed of Astartes was more akin to Cawl and the Avenging Sons enhanced warriors.</p><p>Possessing a suit of Twenty Four Augments instead of the original nineteen these warriors were stronger, faster, and more adaptable than thought possible. Knowledge taken from the Dead of the Grimdark future including destroyed replicates of Belisarius Cawl had allowed this perfection of the Astartes Project. While physically and mentally perfect these warriors still possessed chinks in their armor. Chinks that must be addressed, that duty partially fell to Fabius.</p><p>As they finished their discussion Fabius breached the topic that required the Emperor&apos;s presence: &quot;My Liege your presence informs you already know this, but our supplies of the substance are reaching intolerable lows. It pains me to say this but our current estimates indicate at least three more donations are required before the required Gene-Seed can be produced.&quot;</p><p>At the mention of the &quot;substance&quot;, the Custodes grip on their spears noticeably tightened. Its use and extraction went against every fiber of the Custodes being. It was the closest to torture a member of that order could experience. Even if it was authorized by the Emperor it pained his bodyguards immensely.</p><p>The Substance was one of the rarest and most powerful artifacts in the Imperium let alone the galaxy. Its biological and psychic properties were beyond counting. The term priceless did not come close to describing the importance and rarity of it. Its nature and source were obscured with various clinical terms for utmost secrecy was required. If an enemy acquired even an infinitesimal sample of it hell would be unleashed.</p><p>Nodding solemnly the Emperor spoke in his hypnotic mixture of spoken and psychic communication: &quot;Understandable, we shall extract another donation today. I do not know the next opportunity I will be able to return to the Laboratory so we will do twice the typical amount. That should last until I am available again once we near Solar reunification&quot;</p><p>Any lesser being feeling what the Custodes were would have begged the Emperor not to, he must reconsider. These were not lesser beings and would not fall prey to such weakness. Even in the face of the very thing they were created to prevent. The Emperor&apos;s blood being spilled.</p><p>For that was what the Substance was, the Emperor&apos;s lifeblood itself. It would be used by Fabius and his colleagues to help ensure humanity&apos;s future and that was a cause the Master of Mankind would always give too.</p><p>Following Fabius to the donating chamber, the Emperor of Mankind waited while Fabius prepped the equipment, to harvest let alone preserve such a substance was beyond the capabilities of simple needles and tubing. The hum of the machinery was matched with faint golden sparks occasionally erupting from the Emperor. Subtle but powerful biomancy was underway. Bone-Marrow was supercharged and blood composition was altered to better suit the Projects needs.</p><p>At last the great Sanguine machine came to life. Its receptor extended and opened. Its hollow tubular shape was perfectly sized for the Emperor&apos;s forearm. With a thought, the sleeve of his left arm faded out of being and he placed his perfectly muscled forearm into the device. With the hiss of machinery, a specially designed and sanctified needle entered the Master of Mankind&apos;s vein.</p><p>Enough blood to exsanguinate any mortal man was steadily drained from him. Psychically supercharged biology racing against pumps inscribed with ruins of warding and power. After an hour or so gallons of blood had been extracted and the machine came to a stop. More blood than was physically possible to fit in the Emperor&apos;s body now filled unique holding vessels. The wound closed the minute the needle left the Emperor&apos;s flesh. Utterly unperturbed by the donation he had just given the Master of Mankind left the Chamber with Fabius and the Custodes trailing him.</p><p>As he looked over the thousands and thousands of Progenoids that would each be exposed to far less than a drop of his own blood a single somber thought filled the Emperors ancient and powerful mind. &quot;I hope it will be enough.&quot;</p><p>Final words were exchanged with Fabius and the Emperor prepared to work on the other projects that demanded his attention. So much needed to be done and time was scarce. If he failed quadrillions would be damned. There was so much yet to be done, so many threats and dangers to face. He would face them all and do whatever it took. The Legions would secure the galaxy for humanity and he then his people would be safe to walk the Shining path of Ascension.</p><p>Location: Astartes Candidate Reception Zone XVI, Luna<br>Date: 798.M30</p><p>Uriah Olathaire was both old and young. The Guardian of the Imperial Truth was reaching nearly triple the age he was expected to live too. This, of course, was thanks to the gilded energy gifted from the Emperor that coursed through his body and soul. At fifty he felt ancient, now he wondered how he would feel at five thousand. Despite his vastly extended life and a plethora of experiences Uriah still felt like an overeager wet behind the ears child when compared to the other members of the Emperor&apos;s inner circle.</p><p>For in truth that comparison was rather accurate. Malcador had been a respected member of his order even before the Old Night. Taranis and Valdor were both as old as the Imperium and had fought in its first battles. The Ancient Squat Zamora had traveled with the Emperor during the Old Night and Uriah could only guess the origin and age of the Golden Women who he had witnessed within the Emperor&apos;s quarters</p><p>Even so, this comparable youth was respected by the Imperium for his wisdom and skill. The skills of the clergy and his own natural charisma had ended battles before they had even started. Uriah had preached before millions, conveying the Imperial Truth to the masses. Explaining how any being that demanded worship was unworthy of it. How the god-things the unenlightened worshipped and sacrificed so much for were at best myths and at worst, parasites feeding off of them.</p><p>His duties and roles within the growing Imperium were almost as varied as Malcadors. The groundwork for the Iterator Corps and other public faces of the Imperium had been laid with his assistance. Zealots and Cult Leaders had been debated publicly as a way of showing the masses the ease that their arguments and insanity of their ilk could be dismantled and rebuked. A mastery of rhetoric and a near supernatural charisma had been gifts from the Master of Mankind to assist Uriah. Even after decades of using them the notion his mind and soul had been altered to better suit the Emperor&apos;s needs rather disturbing.</p><p>The fact it did not fill him with horror and disgust at the violation and manipulation just went to show the skill that was used in the act. Uriah was conscious of this and privately wondered how much of the Priest of the Church of Lighting Stone was left within him.</p><p>That soft-spoken old clergyman had been steadily replaced by a confident Imperial Elite. The advocate primus for the Imperial Truth who illuminated the masses to the bright future awaiting humanity and the Imperium. How the Emperor&apos;s sons and the Legions would drive back the darkness and make the Galaxy a place safe for humanity. A place where the wonders of the Golden Age could be surpassed and humanity would become what they had always been destined to be.</p><p>Recently Uriah had his hands full not just with his typical duties but helping smooth Martian-Terran relations, along with dealing with one of the more curious effects of the Astronomicon. The Beacon could be detected anywhere in the Galaxy by most psykers worthy of the designation. To the surprise to all except maybe the Emperor. (it was always hard to tell with him) A surprising number of these Psykers had managed to organize exoduses from the hellholes they originated from.</p><p>Massive migrant fleets had followed the psychic beacon to Terra. Not using it as a point of focus and mapping like a navigator but a simple lighthouse to draw them to port. Every month a few more ragged vessels unworthy to be called Voidships appeared at the outskirts of the Solar System. At first, these refugees had been forced to run a gauntlet of Xeno Slavers to reach Imperial Space. Now the Emperor had adjusted the Astronomicon so its beacon would lure the ragged fleets to protected positions.</p><p>These refugees had in many different forms worshipped the Astronomicon. The more psychically aware had even identified its source as a being and pledged undying rapturous loyalty to the Emperor. The Psychic light of the beacon had a strange effect on humans, all but the most psychically dull could in some way feel it. A calm soothing warmth on the soul that cushioned all those exposed to it from the horrors in the Warp.</p><p>This power while advantageous in reducing the influence of the Four and making dark rituals significantly harder the closer one got to Sol it made Uriah&apos;s duties much harder. The refugee fleets were vindicated fanatics whose faith had become adamantium clad. Convincing them that the Emperor was not a God and that worshipping him as such went against everything the Imperium stood for had been extremely difficult.</p><p>Difficult but mostly successful. The Neologian Corps, an organization founded by Uriah to handle Emperor-Worship and other such salvageable cults had managed to rehabilitate the vast majority of the Refugees. The only notable group of refugees who rejected the Imperial truth no matter the tactics used to illuminate them was ironically the first group.</p><p>The Bearers of the Saving Light as they called themselves had fled an Orkish WAAAGH into the void and warp at the behest of the cult&apos;s founder and Saint, Petronilla Dorovna. Dorovna had started her life as the daughter of scrap merchant, and had through sheer luck underwent her Psychic awakening the moment the Astronomicon light had washed over her homeworld. This confluence of fate had linked her to it. She could sense the beacon, as well as any navigator and the constant presence of its golden light, had convinced her utterly of the Emperor&apos;s divinity.</p><p>This unshakable belief had infecter her followers and she presented a massive ideological danger to the infant Imperium. They had been sequestered away within the Palace and spent their days debating the Neologians and resisting any attempt to rehabilitate them. Uriah had personally debated Dorovna on multiple occasions and was reminded of himself at a younger age to a certain extent.</p><p>These debates had been long arduous affairs that eventually ended with Uriah being called away on some other business and the women&apos;s conviction not wavered in the slightest. This and most of his other duties put a strain on him, the only exception, the only he viewed as more than a duty was his role as counselor and confesser. The living legends and living legends to-be that formed the Emperor&apos;s family and court sought both his wisdom and humanity.</p><p>That role he relished of being able to aide and provide guidance to those around him was why the Emperor had sent him to Luna, the Master of Mankind and the Court of Destiny had realized someone of his talents (and clearance level) was required to help guide a young boy who would be arriving soon to the Genelabs onto a brighter path.</p><p>Leaning on his cane that acted as both badge of office and support for a leg wound that despite healing thanks to the Emperor&apos;s power decades ago still bothered him with psychosomatic pain Uriah watched as hundreds of scared children were corralled off the loading dock. Collected from Chthonia under the pretense of slave raids, which in a sense these harvests were, thousands of children displaying atypical physical and mental fortitude had been brought to Luna.</p><p>Chthonian genetic makeup led to atypical compatibility with the V and XVI legions. Allowing for massive numbers of Astartes to be created from the Ganger children rounded up by the Imperium. The information gleaned from the Court of Destiny told Uriah one of the vessels docking today would hold a boy who could either become an exemplar of the Legio Astartes or a despoiler of countless worlds.</p><p>A series of screams and feral animal-like noises pierced the quiet murmuring of the Void-Dock. Uriah knew at once that was his cue. Moving quickly to the source of the commotion the man who had once been the Last Priest was greeted with a sight that would have almost been amusing if blood and brain matter were not splattered upon those involved. A boy of barely half a Terran decade in age was cornered by a trio of Wardens. A fourth warden lay dead at the child&apos;s feet, still slightly twitching as his blood pooled around his burst skull.</p><p>Somehow the feral youth had managed to escape the processing procession and ambush his pursuers. An improvised leaver had been used to drop cargo onto the Wardens, killing the one and stunning the others long enough for the boy to steal his victims buzz-baton. While still outnumbered the child had turned the batons settings up to a seizure-inducing voltage and kept his foes at bay with it. All while screaming what Uriah assumed were particularly foul Chthonic curses.</p><p>The Wardens, in turn, responded with what Uriah assumed from the tone were equally dire threats in Chthonic. The men and women who sailed to Chtonia and ran the harvests were oftentimes natives of that world or at least could speak their language in passing. This was important in not only establishing positive relations with the youths but for Uriah&apos;s mission.</p><p>Approaching the situation the Guardian of Truth placed his hands on the Wardens shoulders and with confidence born of decades of practice convinced them to leave. He would handle this, the other reason he touched them was to use a psychic gift granted to him by the Emperor in order to assist his duties. By touching a speaker of a language unknown to him Uriah could for a time speak it fluently, as the knowledge was copied over to his brain and usable for a few days.</p><p>As the Wardens backed away he spoke to the youth: &quot;Hello Ezekyle, we have much to discuss&quot;</p><p>Momentary shock flared across the shaggy-haired boy before he regained his composure. Snarling Ezekyle Abaddon answered: &quot;Who the Frak are you and how the Frak do you know my name?&quot;</p><p>Calmly Uriah responded while edging closer to the boy: &quot;My name is Uriah Olathaire, I was sent here by the Emperor to ask you a few questions. Would you mind putting down the baton so we can speak?&quot;</p><p>Charisma be it supernatural or natural no matter how powerful was not enough to break through survival-fear and Ezekyle did not budge. Uriah doubted his words would have had the desired effect but figured it was worth a shot.</p><p>&quot;Do you know why you are here young one?&quot; asked the former Priest as he eased his body weight onto his cane and prepared to speak to the youth at weapon-point</p><p>Shifting his stance slightly while still holding the crackling buzz-baton Ezekyle spook softly &quot;The gang-grabbers said there was a fight, a big fight. It needs Tough-Bastards to win it.&quot;</p><p>A sneer of slight derision passed over the boys face as he continued &quot;What sort of limp-necked gang needs to kiddenap to fight its fights? You have these big movers and plenty of Grabbers to steal us and keep us so why not use them for your fight?&quot;</p><p>Smiling softly Uriah was not surprised the perspective of those born within the depths of hives was often incredibly limited. Abaddon&apos;s answer was technically correct so Uriah continued. &quot;Not a fight my child, a War. A conflict that will only end with humanity ruling the galaxy or dead. Tell me Ezekyle who would you fight and die for?&quot;</p><p>Almost instantly the steely-eyed child answered with conviction and sincerity disturbing for one so young. &quot;My gang and my family. I would kill for them and die to protect them&quot;</p><p>With that statement Uriah knew his mission would be a success, now all that needed to be done was ensure the Child knew the truth of what constituted his tribe and family. &quot;So if a bigger gang attacked both your gang and your neighbor gang would you work together to defeat the threat and become one stronger gang?&quot;</p><p>Tentatively Abaddon nodded in agreement and Uriah went on: &quot;So what if an even worse gang threatened to take your hive away from you and kill your family? Would you fight and die for your entire Hive?&quot;</p><p>Ezekyle Abaddon&apos;s young hive-born mind could scarcely imagine such a devastating conflict but if it were to occur he knew he and his Gang would kill to keep their home. Abaddon said as much and Uriah initiated the final push.</p><p>&quot;What if monsters from beyond the stars invaded your entire world? Things that sought to eat you and your family alive for the sick enjoyment of it? Would you and your world unite to drive off those monsters? I imagine you would, well what if such monsters threatened every human on every world? Would you fight and die to protect another human you never met across the galaxy because they were part of your gang?&quot;</p><p>Still unsure of what the old man was getting at Ezekyle responded &quot;Yeah, if they are part of my gang they would die for me and I would die for them&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well that is the nature of it Ezekyle, our species is one gang, one tribe, one people. There are nightmares that seek to break us and consume us. Simply because we dare to live, we dare to survive and thrive. That is the war you have been chosen to fight. To unite the millions of gangs and worlds of humanity against the coming darkness.&quot; this Speech and countless versions of it had been spoken by Uriah to help sway entire nations to the Imperiums cause.</p><p>Preparing to finish Uriah could sense his words entering the boy&apos;s mind and soul. &quot;That is what the Imperium is, that is what the Emperor&apos;s dream is. To bring unity to Humanity. We must stand together as a people against the darkness or be swallowed piecemeal by it. Will you stand as a Warrior of Humanity? A Soldier in the Legion of Light?&quot;</p><p>Slowly lowering his stolen weapon the illuminated child answered Uriah and denied the Dark Gods their greatest champion &quot;Yes, I will stand and fight.&quot;</p><p>Approaching and placing his hand on the child&apos;s shoulders Uriah thanked Ezekyle for his strength and willingness to fight. He walked the boy who would be a legend to the Processing center and prepared to leave Luna. For his countless other duties awaited.</p><p>Uriah was not privy to the events he had set in motion but others were. Within the Imperial Palace as he watched his sons and their legions practice the Emperor of Mankind felt the fates shift. Soon Ezekyle Abaddon would become one of humanity&apos;s greatest heroes, instead of one of its greatest foes.</p><p>The boy would undergo the implantation of Gene Seed and by a one in a billion odds become greater than virtually any Astartes. He along with a few other names that would go down in the histories of the Legio Astartes was uniquely compatible with his Primarchs genes. Abaddon would be empowered to become something greater than an Astartes but less than a Primarch. Similar to Ghota&apos;s relation to Arik Taranis, Abaddon would become the greatest Son of Horus.</p><p>Peering into the Future the Emperor let out a deep sigh and thought to himself. &quot;Fourteen Years till the Crusade is ready. Any longer and our window is too short.&quot;</p><p>Focusing for a moment the Master of Mankind manipulated the Astronomicon. Golden Psychic-Fire that washed through the Warp started to pulse at a strange frequency. Only a being of the Warp and incredibly powerful could determine the message conveyed by viewing these fluctuations in their entirety.</p><p>The Four self-proclaimed Gods detected the message and howled in fury and just a hint of fear as the Emperor&apos;s words crashed into them. &quot;Your Doom is coming&quot;</p>
