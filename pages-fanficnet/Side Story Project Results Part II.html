<p>Primarch: XI Kalib Kraad</p><p>Foster World: The Labyrinth- Space Hulk that suffered extreme Warp contamination. Raised ferally with no humans or sentients on Hulk. Fought constantly against Daemonic incursions and lived off of mutated vermin.</p><p>Discovery: 18th Psychic signature detected by us and we lead a company of his legion in purging the Hulk and discovering the feral mutated Primarch. Killed a dozen of his own legion before being subdued.</p><p>Capabilities: Displayed virtual immunity to Chaos and possessed a psychotic instinctive hatred of Warpspawn and a master of eliminating them. Heavily mutated, with physical capabilities greater than most of his siblings. Mute do to Daemonic venom affecting his vocal cords.</p><p>Legion: Silent Brotherhood- a Brutal close-range combatant who inspire an extreme amount of Transhuman Dread in any humans they encounter. Mutated Omophagea that caused a craving for human flesh and blood, and empowers Legionaries who feed often and plentifully. Intensity of mutation only increased with Primarch sourced Geneseed.</p><p>Heresy: Traitor- Purged long before the Heresy when it was discovered the Legion had been cannibalizing entire human worlds populations. Attempted an unknown sorcerous ritual as the VI closed in as an attempt to escape judgment. Primarch disappeared into the warp due to Ritual and 95% of the Legion was purged by the VI Legion.</p><p>Fate: Believed to have achieved Pseudo-Daemonhood as a minor Warp deity. Currently a minor player in the Great Game that seeks to destroy both the Imperium and Chaos. Survivors of the Legion reappeared after the Great Scouring, tricked Imperium and became a now renegade Astartes Chapter.</p><p>Conclusion: Extreme Failure- Corrupted and mutated by Warp influence from birth. Displayed extreme psychological instability and a mix of both natural and warpborn insanity. His legions mutations caused the deaths of billions and even after returning to the Imperial Fold they betrayed us and worship there fallen Primarch.</p><hr size="1" noshade><p>Primarch: XII Angron</p><p>Foster World: Nuceria- Civilized World where ruling elite used gladiatorial combat to placate the masses. XII was discovered by a Slaver after a failed assassination attempt on him by the Eldar. Subjected to crude Cruciamen Surgery he became a star gladiator. Eventually, lead a failed slave insurrection with his fellow gladiators.</p><p>Discovery: 17th- Refused to join the Imperium and attacked Custodes and XII Legionnaires sent to negotiate. Nuceria was becoming compliant and PA8&apos;s taint was plain to see on both him and his gladiator comrades. They were not salvageable but XII was and his Legion would be broken if he was not.</p><p>Capabilities: Extreme aggression and combat capabilities originating from the Butchers Nails turned XII into a brutally effective weapon. His legion proved exemplar shock troopers and force of mass destruction. The Cruciamen Surgery robbed XII of his Superhuman intellect and strategic capability reducing him from a general and hero to a butchers tool.</p><p>Legion: World Eaters- Extremely brutal shock troops who specialized in slaughtering their enemy with extreme prejudice. Recruited from the most aggressive candidates and served originally with gruesome effectiveness. Forced into Cruciamen Surgery by XII.</p><p>Heresy: Traitor- Joined XVI in an attempt to be free and get revenge. Committed some of the worst atrocities of the war upon Ultramar along with XVIII. Was critically wounded during the so-called &quot;Shadow Crusade&quot; and was forcefully ascended to Daemonhood by XVIII.</p><p>Fate: Currently acts as one of PA8&apos;s champions and periodically invades the Imperium only to be banished at great cost. Legion was broken into warbands by the actions of a certain Terran Marine (See Terran Traitors) XII Legion has completely fallen to PA8 and are Cruciamen-mutilated berserkers.</p><p>Conclusion: Extreme Failure- Cruciamen Surgery had mutilated and broken him to the point of being more monster than man. Broke his Legion mind, body and soul. Desired to be free, but could never realize he was enslaved to his own past and weakness. Responsible for a truly colossal amount of death and destruction in his madness.</p><hr size="1" noshade><p>Primarch: Primarch XIII Roboute Guilliman</p><p>Foster World: Macragge- Civilized World and former Capital System of the Ultramarc League. Regressed into a semi-authoritarian but cohesive society. Maintained a decent technology base and was capable of low-level Warp Travel and trade with fellow former Capital Systems.</p><p>Discovery: 8th- Ruled homeworld after avenging Foster Father&apos;s death at hands of political rivals. Forged Macragge and nearby worlds into a New Ultramarc League. Gladly joined the Imperium yet kept growing his own Empire of &quot;Ultramar&quot;</p><p>Capabilities: Arguably the greatest analyst and organizer among the Primarchs. Excelled at planning macro-projects to the nth degree. Slightly above average combatant compared to others. More a builder and ruler of Empires then a warrior.</p><p>Legion: Ultramarines- Highly organized tactically adept Legion that specializes in adaptability and discipline. Capable of fighting with extreme synchronization despite being the largest Legion. Regimental and doctrine heavy mindset can cause issues if lacking a leader capable of adapting to the situation.</p><p>Heresy: Loyal- Believed Terra had fallen and sequestered themselves in Ultramar and were sealed off from the rest of the Galaxy by the Ruin/Storm phenomena. Formed the Imperium Secundus with I and IX. Eventually helped lift the Siege of Terra after the Duel.</p><p>Fate: Crippled in duel with III and placed in Stasis. Rebuilt the Imperium post-scouring in order to try and prevent another Heresy class event. Invented and championed the implementation of the Chapter System.</p><p>Conclusion: Semi-Successful- Proved to be one of the most psychologically stable Primarchs who helped salvage the Imperium post-heresy. Displayed a possibly neurotic propensity to order and organization that caused rifts with some Primarchs.</p><hr size="1" noshade><p>Primarch: XIV Mortarion</p><p>Foster World: Barburus- Slave World ruled by PA7 corrupted Xenos. Toxic fog covered it and sheltered the Xenos in their high altitude kingdoms. XIV was raised by the chieftain of these Xenos and was warped physically and mentally by the toxins and abuse.</p><p>Discovery: 13th- escaped his Xeno captor and started a rebellion. Met with him and noticed hints of corruption, issued challenge to analyze psych profile and capabilities. Failed but did not display corruption. Spent time on Terra and showed psychological instability.</p><p>Capabilities: Extreme regenerative capabilities beyond other Primarchs and unrivaled bio-adaptation abilities related to toxins and detrimental environments. Lacked martial skill and strategic capabilities compared to siblings and used extreme regenerative abilities and strength.</p><p>Legion: Deathguard- Massed infantry specialists who relied on numbers, sheer endurance and biochemical WMD&apos;s to best foes. Very useful in toxic or contaminated environments. Organized in massive Great Companies.</p><p>Heresy: Traitor- Declared for Horus quickly and proved to be one of XVI&apos;s key generals. Experimented with Warp Craft on multiple occasions despite his hatred of it, in order to bind or destroy Warp-phenomena. Legion fleet betrayed by First captain (See Calas Typhon) and became thralls of PA7</p><p>Fate: Atypically independent God-Thrall that rules over vast stretches of the Eldars Folly. Legion divided between his followers and those of his first captain. Ironically appears to have become a twisted mimicry of the Xeno who adopted him.</p><p>Conclusion: Failure- His Armor of Contempt was mutated by his experiences on Barbarus into a paranoid hatred of anything he viewed as Warp-Tainted. (justly or unjustly) As unstable as VIII and XII yet better at hiding it. Severe physical and psychological ailments plagued him thanks toBarburus.</p><hr size="1" noshade><p>Primarch: XV Magnus the Red.</p><p>Foster World: Prospero- Civilized World settled by Exiles fleeing the Psi-Wars of Terra. Plagued by Warp-Parasites that Magnus lead the extermination of. Prospero was rebuilt by XV as a place of culture and learning where its Psyker population could live in peace.</p><p>Discovery: 9th, Psychically detected traveling the Immaterium in a reckless fashion. Joined peacefully and given warning of the Warp. Attempted to solve Legions mutation and made a bargain with PA9, lost an Eye and became marked as property by the Warp Entity.</p><p>Capabilities: Alpha Plus Psyker of extreme power and control. One of the greatest intellects of the Primarchs with a thirst for knowledge both practical and theoretical. Extremely arrogant due to powers and ignored warnings. Possesed the capabilities but not the aptitude to become the Throne-Lord.</p><p>Legion: Thousand Sons- Geneseed enhances existing psychic potential and can unlock dormant sensitivity. Suffered from extreme mutation related to Warp-Corruption. Stabilised by XV and began to master Warp-Craft. Bound hostile Warp Entities to themselves and engaged in Sorcery</p><p>Heresy: Loyal/Traitor Discovered XVI&apos;s corruption and attempted to prove merits of Sorcery by contacting us on the Throne, his Psi-signature allowed him to puncture the wards and rip open the Throne-Gate. VI sent to apprehend him in order to have another Gate-Holder. XVI&apos;s tampering and VI&apos;s errors caused calamity (See Burning of Prospero)</p><p>Fate: Psyche shattered by ritual on Prospero, 65% of original Soul fused with PA9&apos;s power to create a God-Thrall known as the Crimson King. The remaining 35% either fused with our Oversoul or became the core of the First Lord of Titan.</p><p>Conclusion: Extreme Failure- Despite or maybe because his many gifts he displayed worrying egotistical tendencies while being overconfident in his knowledge and power. Refused our advice, became bound to PA9 and was used to ruin the primary golden path.</p><p><em>*Our Lord of Ways... Ended our path... irony... Only by our blood...could they ruin the gate*</em></p><hr size="1" noshade><p>Primarch: XVI Horus Lupercal</p><p>Foster World: Cthonia- Mining/Feral World stripped of all resources and home to vicious tunnel gangs that brawled over the planets Scraps. Brutal conditions and nearness to Terra allowed for excellent Astartes recruits of Genetics close to Terran Standard. Early expedition fleets harvested Chthonian gangers as Legion stock and an adolescent XVI was discovered.</p><p>Discovery: XVI was biologically three years old and appeared a human male approximately 6-9 years in age. Discovered quickly and was personally tutored and trained by us. Served by our side along till VI was discovered and at first seemed the perfect proof of concept for the Primarchs.</p><p>Capabilities: Under out tutoring he mastered every science and skill to learn and displayed a Charisma and social Intellect outstripping most of his siblings which allowed him to enthrall those weaker than him and befriend his brothers. One of the most martially skilled Primarchs excelling in decapitation strategy.</p><p>Legion: Luna Wolves/Sons of Horus/Black Legion- The Geneseed of XVI was one of the most potent lines further enhanced by XVI&apos;s latent psychic abilities and possessed far larger numbers of Gene-synced Legionnaires including arguably the greatest successes of Lineage syncing and future leader of the reformed XVI Legion Ezekyle Abaddon. Preferred flexibility and command structure elimination tactics.</p><p>Heresy: Loyal/Traitor- Was poisoned by Kinebatch weapon-host containing the Elder Neverborn known as Bruticai. While crippled by the Weapon a ritual lead by the Dark Chaplain Erebus reprogramed his mind and soul to have him start a Rebellion against us under the control of the Warp.</p><p>Fate: Was put down during the Siege of Terra after we cast aside our newly reclaimed humanity and struck against the Four through his conduit to them. His Soul was erased to save him from further Chaotic predations and attempts to clone him were stopped by the Thralls of Imperious.</p><p>Conclusion: Failure- Showed incredible promise and capabilities yet displayed numerous personality flaws related to egotism and abandonment that provided the chinks in his armor the Warp could infiltrate. Should have died a Legend instead of living to become an abomination.</p><hr size="1" noshade><p>Primarch: XVII Lorgar Aurelian</p><p>Foster World: Colchis- Feudal Arid world that managed to survive the Old Night by making pacts with Warp Entities. Regressed from its Industrial history into zealotry and barbarism. Primordial Annihilator Thrall-Cults made up the State religion.</p><p>Discovery: 14th- Uncontrolled Psychic powers allowed XVII to predict our arrival and interpreted it as a &quot;Divine&quot; message. Lead a religious war against the prime Colchisian cult and won through charisma and dogma instead of martial skill or strategy. We initially believed his purging of his home-worlds taint and enthusiastic loyalty to us were signs of XVII resisting corruption like I. We were extremely mistaken.</p><p>Capabilities: Never refined his martial capabilities and seemed opposed to learning military tactics and skills. Preferred to use his Charisma, both psychic and natural to win battles. Formidable Psychic powers that were further enhanced by Warp-Corruption. Naturally dogmatic and a true believer in his cause, showed remarkable manipulative and social engineering talent.</p><p>Legion: Word Bearers: Extremely fanatical, to an unhealthy degree. Would die or worse for their cause. Hyper-Sensitive to XVII charisma. Started as our Anti-cult force, with their neural programming keeping them strict followers of the Imperial Truth. Once converted by XVII they became Religious Zealots of the worst kind would commit unnecessary atrocities to feed the Pantheon.</p><p>Heresy: Refused multiple messages, summons, and warnings to discontinue conversion of worlds to a doctrine worshiping us. Eventually, we were forced to castigate him and it became apparent XVII had been corrupted since theft and was a serious security risk. Our attempts to minimize fallout were partially successful and he was designated as one of the Acceptable Losses.</p><p>Fate: After orchestrating the Consumption of XII by PA8, the Heresy War and accidentally creating the Imperial Cult XVII retreated into the Eldars Folly. Has delved deeper into the Warp and become utterly engrossed in the Warps corruption and pays little attention to the Material Realm.</p><p>Conclusion: Extreme Failure- Should have been euthanized at Monarchia. Our hopes to give XVII a chance to redeem itself and fulfill its potential were destroyed. Indoctrinated by the Primordial Annihilator pathetically easily, XVII willingly sacrificed its sons and the galaxy to the Warp.</p><hr size="1" noshade><p>Primarch: XVIII Vulkan</p><p>Foster World: Nocturne - A Volcanic Death World settled by a group of genetically modified Pacifists during the Golden Age. Part of a binary with its oversized moon Prometheus. The Gravitational interplay between the twin bodies causes extreme tectonic instability on Nocturne. The Wildlife was almost as equally dangerous as the environment and the people learned to survive this harsh world within their Sanctuary Cities.</p><p>Discovery: 6th - Was one of the three that required us to best them in competition. We used it as an opportunity to test XVIII&apos;s physical and intellectual skills. We considered allowing XVIII to fail the last test and perish in order to activate his abilities. Decided to save him to ensure loyalty.</p><p>Capabilities: One of the most physically powerful Primarch. Possessing endurance, durability, and strength virtually unmatched among the others. Slightly slower and more ponderous in comparison to projected baseline. Most likely side effect of upbringing on high Gravity death world. Extremely inventive with fundamental knowledge inbuilt into him. High morality and ethics thanks to genetic and cultural factors. Perfect for our purposes.</p><p>Legion: Salamanders: Durable, loyal and inventive as their gene-father. Served with distinction during both Crusade and Unification. Almost wiped out due to extensive casualties before XVIII was found and again during the Drop Site Massacre. Survive to this day and serve with distinction and atypical compassion.</p><p>Heresy: Was one of the three Loyal Primarchs betrayed at the Drop Site Massacre. Was captured by VIII and tortured into insanity. Managed to escape to Ultramar and was kept by XIII at his Contingency Empire. Was seemingly killed by the Cabals plots but the use of the Fulgurite allowed us to extend our influence on him and craft our contingencies.</p><p>Fate: After assisting in the Destruction of a Beast class WAAAGH he made his way back to the Imperial Palace and awaits the day the Terminus Decree is used. If such an event does occur the Artifacts of Vulkan if gathered together can be used to summon him from Terra&apos;s ashes to lead humanity.</p><p>Conclusion: Success- Was created as a contingency and tool to not only preserve the human species but its humanity. As solid as the Old Earth the kindest soul is prepared to do great evil and good if it means the survival of our people.</p><hr size="1" noshade><p>Primarch: XIX Corvus Corax</p><p>Foster World: Deliverance/Lycaeus- Mineral Rich Moon of Forge world Kiavahr. Populated by mining slaves who adopted XIX upon his arrival. Raised him to be their revolutionary Leader and liberator. Succeeded in this endeavor and broke the Tech-Clan enslavers.</p><p>Discovery: 19th- Our expedition fleet arrived in the Kiavahr system almost immediately after the end of XIX&apos;s revolution. Meeting went well with XIX seeing our physical body. Unification with legion occurred sub-par. XIX rebuilt his legion from the ground up to better favor his tactical skills and to purge undesirable elements.</p><p>Capabilities: Intelligent and observant XIX personified the skill set and personality types adept at stealth and shadow operations. Inherited our psychic ability to erase our presence, which was passed along his Gene-line to a certain extent. Extremely introspective and excellent at observing the true nature of things.</p><p>Legion: Raven Guard: Like their gene-source the XIXth Legion operated with efficiency, stealth, and precision. While never a particularly large Legion the Raven Guard was extremely effective at destroying non-compliant governments and liberating enslaved humans. Noted to generally, have atypical moral centers due to the more flexible Astartes being exiled to a number of unsanctioned successors.</p><p>Heresy: Loyal: Suffered horrifically at the Drop Site Massacre, the vast majority of the XIX Legion was wiped out and XIX himself was gravely wounded. Fears related to the true nature of the Primarchs caused a psychological crisis that was further exacerbated by a failed rebuilding of his legion using our knowledge. Spent the latter years of the Heresy running guerrilla campaigns against Traitor supply lines with his mutant Astartes acting as shock-troopers.</p><p>Fate: Post-heresy he supported XIII&apos;s reforms and returned to his homeworld to euthanize the mutant Raven Guard Astartes. This finally caused XIX&apos;s psychological breakdown. Fled into the Warp in an attempt to redeem himself. Unlocked his full warp-born potential and exists as an icon of fear for the Traitors to this day. This Crow-King warp-monster and the myths of VIII are the inspiration for the Raptor-God minor warp-deity.</p><p>Conclusion: Semi-Successful: Competent in his skill set and willing to do what was necessary to protect the Imperium. XIX&apos;s strong moral compass allowed him to be an effective leader and liberator of humanity, it also spelled his downfall. While he possessed the skills and nature to make difficult decisions his morality made living with the necessary evil far too straining on his psyche.</p><hr size="1" noshade><p>Primarch: Alpharius Omegon</p><p>Foster World: *DATA CORRUPTED*</p><p>Discovery: *DATA CORRUPTED*/20th: *DATA CORRUPTED*</p><p>Capabilities: Masters of espionage, counterespionage, and sabotage. The XX&apos;s were masters of unconventional warfare and could destroy a civilization without the use of a single weapon. Possessed a psychic link between the two that helped them keep in touch with each other, and this link could be used to empower Legionaries to impersonate them. Physically less powerful than their siblings the XX&apos;s relied on their intellect and planning skills over martial capabilities.</p><p>Legion: Alpha Legion: Heavily compartmentalized with squads trained to work as independent units. Larger than average Astartes to allow their Primarchs to mask as them. Sleeper cells of XX Legionaries present in all other legions. Stealth operations supplemented with Human auxilla operatives. When forced into open combat shock and awe tactics were favored by the XX Legion.</p><p>Heresy: *DATA CORRUPTED*: Legion and Primarchs both acted in the interest of both sides of the Heresy at various points. Believed to be influenced by a Xeno organization known as the Cabal, but the truth of the matter is obscured from our sight. Tested Sol&apos;s defense during the battle of Pluto and eventually lost control of the Legion by the Ullanor Muster of Horus.</p><p>Fate: XX-1 was executed for treachery in combat during the Battle of Pluto. XX-2 continued to &quot;lead&quot; the Alpha Legion until *DATA CORRUPTED*</p><p>Conclusion: Success: *DATA CORRUPTED*</p>
