The Emperor and Death (An old theory of mine that helped inspire this story.)</p><p>This is a pet theory of mine about The Nature of the Emperor and his power. I intend to incorporate parts of it into the story so I figured I would post the prototype version of it. The evidence seems to suggest the origin involving the Shamans is true, The Emperor seems rather powerful for that alone. The Shamans at best were probably at most around an Eldar Farseer in power, and if the combined might of a few thousand Farseer class Psychics were an actual threat to Chaos... Well, Slaanesh would be running with its... tail between its legs. So a few possibilities emerge.</p><p>A. the Shamans were much more powerful which is a possibility but considering what we know about human psychics, that many Alpha+ Psykers seems unlikely and flat-out dangerous.</p><p>B. the effects are multiplicative which if true means Ynnead once its full power is unlocked will be able to curb-stomp the Chaos gods easily.</p><p>C. is he stole most of his power on Moloch which seems unlikely considering he managed to seal the Void Dragon/Dragon of Mars away during the Middle Ages.</p><p>D. is my personal theory. Which is incredibly ironic, explains some of the Emperors more dickish tendencies and also supplies hope for Humanity.</p><p>The basics of this theory are that the Emperor is the Human Afterlife. We know the fate of Eldar and Chaos worshipers when the die (eaten/absorbed/collected by their gods) but what about Humanity in general?In &apos;Master of Mankind&apos; we saw the Emperor Summon up &quot;ghosts&quot; of Imperial Heroes to help in the War of the Webway, these could be psychic projections but what if they literally were the souls of fallen humans? This would explain why the Emperor is so powerful, every human not corrupted by Chaos fuses with also explains why his appearance and personality appear to shift, he is a mixture of trillions of souls of varying morality and nature. The Emperor is not just the Master of Mankind but Mankind itself.</p><p>Being the Human Afterlife would explain quite a few of the Emperors traits and abilities. His hatred of Religion makes perfect sense when you realize he knows \ the truth of the Afterlife, and how many Religions are touched by Chaos so they steal souls away from his protection. The Emperor&apos;s Xenophobia also is justified. All the suffering and death caused by Xeno&apos;s during the Age of Strife, he felt every death and betrayal.</p><p>The Age of Strife would also explain how the Emperor became as obscenely powerful he is. How much of humanity do you think died during it? How many Trillions or Quadrillions of humans perished and joined the Gestalt-God that is the Emperor is humanity&apos;s champion and protector, it would make sense for him to not just physically but to spiritually protect humanity. He was created as Human Pseudo-Infinity Circuit to protect us from the dangers of the Galaxy and Warp.</p><p>The hope in this theory comes when you realize how many Humans have died in his service in the Age of Imperium. It would seem that he had one last grisly trick up his sleeve even after the Human-Webway failed. The death and horror of the Imperium are the ultimate gambits, it feeds Chaos but also feeds the Emperor. This would explain why Chaos has not fully succeeded and broken down the walls of reality and why the Legion of the Damned (who appear to be Imperial Daemons) are appearing more and more often. The Emperor is growing in power and holding Chaos at bay</p><hr size="1" noshade><p>3. Rebuilding Humanities Technology</p><p>One thing that will be touched on throughout this story that I don&apos;t think sees enough light is the issues with rebuilding humanities tech-base. The standard line of thought both in and out of universe is that a complete uncorrupted STC will solve all of the Imperium&apos;s technological woes and propel humanity back to its golden age. This is sadly not true. The Iron War did not just destroy Galactic Human Civilization but also permanently ruined entire fields of science so that anything related to them could cause a galaxy-wide holocaust of organic life. All technology that relies on Artifical intelligence, Silicon-based computers, and information networking has to be scrapped to be never used again. Imagine what would happen to modern Earths technology and society if those particular facets of technology were completely off-limits, now add more than 20,000 years of scientific advances into the problem.</p><p>It&apos;s not just a simple case of recovering ancient tech, but of discovering entirely new forms of technology that humanity never knew about or needed to investigate due to the effectiveness of AI. The Emperor and Malcador have access to truly colossal amounts of Golden Age tech and knowledge but a lot of it is simply unusable without Chaos/C&apos;tan/Rogue A.S.I. contamination turning whatever your building against you in the most unpleasant ways possible. STC&apos;s that don&apos;t rely on this forbidden tech are not uncommon and will greatly benefit the Imperium but the vast majority of truly advanced stuff like what we saw with the Speranza is unusable.</p><p>The Mechanicum comes into this with being one of the few organizations in the galaxy that are the jury-rigging old tech to work with safer alternatives along with making new advances with safer alternatives like Biologically based computers, Neurolinked Data-Nets, and Organic Robots. So while gathering STC&apos;s is useful and will speed up humanities return to Golden Age heights they are in no way an end-all-be-all solution to humanities woes. This is also why numerous &quot;complete&quot; STC&apos;s or hyper-advanced human-based tech was destroyed in the Great Crusade. Civilizations like the Interex or the Olamic Quietude were wiped out or at least did not have there tech integrated into the Imperium because they were headed down the path of either having there tech corrupted or another AI rebellion occurring.</p><p>We will see humanities technology resurge in this story with the Mechanicum and more tech aligned Primarchs discovering and developing technology to help advance humanity. Psi-tech will also be something to be played around with since humanities advancement into a species of stable psykers is the Emperors goal.</p><hr size="1" noshade><p>4. Reapers and Murderers (A theory that has some importance for the later plot)</p><p>Something that never seemed to make sense about the Nightbringers story is how a being that is anathema to the Immaterium would have such a massive effect on it. Creating a warp-concept of the Grim-Reaper and instilling an irrational fear of death in sentients seems outside of the capabilities of C&apos;tan. It would be like the Chaos Gods altering the laws of physics. The Chaos Gods are masters of the Immaterium and can only influence the Material realm by injecting parts of there dimension into ours. (Possession, Warprifts, Daemon Worlds.) Similarly, the C&apos;tan lack the ability to alter the Warp and as far as we know never attempted &quot;reverse possession&quot; or something similar into the Warp (Although the Pylons and there devouring of souls/life energy might be the equivalent.)</p><p>A purely material being messing with the Immaterium so species never even touched by the Old Ones developed the Idea of the Reaper seems impossible, until you remember one particular incident during the War in Heaven. Khaine and the Nightbringer duked it out with Khaine emerging victorious. During the fight, a shard of the Nightbringer was claimed/stolen/put inside by Khaine and became his Reaper Aspect. This leaves the possibility that this was less of Khaine taking a part of the Nightbringer but them exchanging something. With Khaine gaining the aspect of the Reaper and the Nightbringer interacting with the Warp in some way. With Khaine being a Warp God touched by the material and The Nightbringer being a C&apos;tan touched by the Warp. Considering what we know about Aza&apos;Gorod and his gluttonous tendencies it seems possible he did &quot;something&quot; to the Warp (possibly an attack on souls mid-reincarnation?) to seriously mess with it in an attempt to feed on the soul stuff of it.</p><p>To add another layer to this is the Avatar of Khaine. They seem to be utterly incongruous with what we know of Eldar tech and lore. Being made of an unknown metal and seemingly existing even before the fall in some form or another. With Avatars of Khaine like the Warshard existing in places that predate his Shattering and the fall by thousands if not millions of years. What if a metaphorical concept was not the only thing taken from the Nightbringer but an actual shard of his necrodermis body. Which the Ancient Eldar crafted into Altars of Khaine. (I mean using bits of fallen foes in religious site to Khaine is practically his whole shtick) These Altars fitting to a Wargod could probably channel a portion of his power into them much like the modern Avatars but most likely significantly stronger if the Warshard is anything to go by. Then when Khaine was broken and the Material became the hunting ground for Slaanesh his pieces fled to the only safety left, his foothold in the Material.</p><p>So it seems likely that the Nightbringer was the only C&apos;tan to leave such a visceral effect on the immaterium, while the rest simply messing with the Material instead. Also, the idea that the Avatars are soul-containers crafted by the Ancient Eldar is backed up by Avatars being defeated and possessed. As seen by two particularly unlucky ones that a Keeper of Secrets and Genestealer Patriarch managed to take over. While this theory does seem like it has little to do with this story the War in Heaven is going to be majorly involved with later plot and I wanted to sort of introduce some of that.</p><hr size="1" noshade><p>5. Chaos Unborn</p><p>Another Theory I have been tooling with over the years. This may or may not be related to this story, in particular, the Identity of some of the other PA#&apos;s Which is the Emperors scientific classification for the Chaos Gods. PA9 being Tzeentch PA8 being Khorne, PA7 being Nurgle and PA6 being Slaanesh.</p><p>The Four Chaos Gods are arguably the greatest threat to known existence (we don&apos;t know how dangerous the &apos;Nids truly are) They were responsible for some of the greatest calamities in Galactic history, from the Age of Strife to the 13th Black Crusade and the Great Rift, but how do we know there are only Four? Now I know what you&apos;re thinking &quot;oh boy here we go about Malal&quot; but the Renegade God is not the focus of this theory. I theorize Malal may just be the tip of a very big and very dangerous iceberg.</p><p>I speak of Chaos Unborn, possible Chaos gods that might be born or be in the process of being born. We know that Chaos gods are typically born slowly and steadily over vast periods of time and that Slaanesh is an oddity, so could other aspects of mortal emotions be congealing in the Warp? The reason I started thinking about this was some reading I was doing into Warhammer Fantasy and how Be&apos;lakor is referred to as the only Daemon Prince of Chaos Undivided. This seems extremely contradictory to 40k that has many Daemon Princes of Chaos Undivided, such as Lorgar, Perturabo and Ingethel. This could be a simple lore differentiation but I thought that it might be more. What if Chaos Undivided is not Undivided but Chaos Unborn. With these Daemon Princes being servants of unborn gods.</p><p>The three main aspects of Chaos undivided that do not seem to fit under any other gods banner seem like good possibles for Unborn Chaos Gods. The first of these is what I am going to call the Dark Machine, the thing that is worshiped by the Dark Mechanicum, the Kai-Smiths and might be the Unborn patron of Perturabo. Second is The Raptor-God the entity that is Worshiped by the Raptor-Cults and may be the Chaos God of Fear, considering its worshipers. Lastly and most terrifying is the Unborn God of Faith, this being is the most likely result of the Word-bearers efforts and the countless lesser Cults across the Galaxy.</p><p>This Unborn god might be related to what Lorgar has been up too for the last 10k years. The really scary thing is what if this Faith god might not just be a god of dark faiths but related to the Faith in the Emperor. What if a mutated Half God-Emperor half Chaos God is gestating in the Warp being fed by the blind faith of the Imperium and the insanity of Chaos Undivided?</p><hr size="1" noshade><p>6. Smoke on the Water, Fire in the Warp: Or how the Chaos Gods perspective for Chapters 10 and 11.</p><p>Imagine you are a Leviathan, a lord of the Deep that can summon hurricanes with a breath. You reach out of the sea and drag your prey into the depths for your own amusement. You and your siblings are the undisputed masters of your domain, every being in the depths serves you or fears you. Yet you hunger for more, to drag all that lies in the light into the depths, to reach out from beneath the waves and pull the continents into the sea.</p><p>Now imagine there is a hunter, a brave surface dweller who can travel the depths unmolested and seeks to slay each of you. No matter what you try, you can not destroy him, he is beyond your reach and worse still he has a plan. A plan to starve you till you waste away, till your once great form is rotten and skeletal, till you are weak and broken. Then he will poison the ocean, make it so what had once been your domain is now anathema to your very being. You, your siblings and your spawn will die slow horrible deaths as the Hunters own children take to the poisoned sea now that it is safe from your hunger.</p><p>Yet you and your siblings also have a plan, a plan to stop the Hunter and use his own might against him. You plot to steal his young and twist them to your will. Force him to raise vipers in his nest, half of them will fall and drag there father into the depths with them. If you succeed not only will the hunter be broken utterly, turned into a living ever-screaming corpse but his greatest works will chum the waters and feed you well until you are strong enough to pull the world into the sea, where it will be yours to feed upon and play with for all eternity.</p><p>The Plan is working, the bait has been laid and the Hunters Spawn are almost in your embrace, then suddenly everything is burning, your minions are ripped apart by the ghosts of broken tools and the spawn are safe. Before you can even realize what has occurred and start to plan something new the Ocean is alight. The surface of the sea is burning, the Hunter has somehow become something greater. No longer a monster-slayer but a Lord of the Surface and the Skies. He lets just a small trickle of his blood fall into the sea and the surface is ablaze. No matter how much you rage, the storms you seek to make are burned upon the surface. Each foray above the waves becomes a painful race against time for leaving the safety of the depths exposes you to scorching flames. Flames fed by all those you sought to feed off and play with.</p><p>You realize your great scheme has failed, the Hunter and his spawn are coming. You once master of the depths now know something new, what its like to be preyed upon, what its like to be the victim of something beyond your imagination, to reap a terrible reward for misguided greedy actions. In short, the suffering you have long inflicted upon the Hunters people is now yours.</p>
