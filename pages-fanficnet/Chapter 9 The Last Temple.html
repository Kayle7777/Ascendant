<p><strong>Chapter Nine: The First Temple</strong></p><p>Uriah Olathaire was old, not just physically but mentally and spiritually. he could feel the weight of the years in his bones and upon his soul. Ironically he had not lived as many years as some and was just entering the second half of his life. Yet the years he had spent alive were especially harsh ones. Wars had been fought, families lost, homes burned and ways of life driving to extinction.</p><p>These thoughts occupied the old Priest of the Church of the Lighting Stone as he extinguished candles and cleaned the old place of worship. Uriah had joined the creed as a young man and had watched as his congregation had shrunk with each passing year. The Emperor&apos;s &quot;truth&quot; saw to that. Religion had been declared the enemy, a source of woes and misery. Every Month new reports came in of great Cathedrals and Temples being looted, converted and torn down.</p><p>Horror stories of clerics and Cardinals being dragged away into the night persisted, with many religious sights becoming abandoned due to their clergy fleeing the Emperor&apos;s minions. Some of Uriah&apos;s more devout partitioners had asked and even begged to help him flee the purges. He had turned each and every one of them down. Telling each that &quot;I have lived for this church and if need be I will die for this church&quot;</p><p>Eventually even those most devout had stopped coming, the past few weeks Uriah had been alone in the ancient building. With nothing but the crashing of the seas waves and ancient scripture for company. Letting out a deep sigh the Old Priest went to lock the great oaken doors of the building. Right as he approached them a knock sounded at the door.</p><p>Sighing to himself Uriah went to the door, wondering who could have come calling at this late hour. The doors swing open and a man stood before Uriah. Clothed in the uniform of an Imperial Officer the raven-haired man struck an imposing figure. The Man looked into Uriah&apos;s eyes and the Priest had the unpleasant sensation that he was being studied like a scientific specimen being prepared for dissection. A subconscious shiver ran up Uriah&apos;s spine at the thought.</p><p>The strange man reached out his hand to shake Uriah&apos;s and spoke: &quot;You are Father Uriah Olathaire: Priest of the Lighting Stone Church correct?&quot; Refocusing and shaking off the momentary anxiety Uriah took the strangers hand and spoke: &quot;Yes, and you are?&quot; &quot;You can simply call me Revelation.&quot; Uriah scoffed at that &quot;How ominous, what can this old priest help you with Revelation?&quot;</p><p>A momentary pained expression crossed the Strangers face before he continued &quot;I seek your counsel.&quot; Revelations inflection stunk of disdain, and he was obviously disgusted with the idea. Uriah had seen pride and ego of countless varieties throughout his tenure and he could easily recognize the signs of a man who detested asking for help. A kind smile appeared on the priests face and he spoke &quot;Of course my son. Come in, come in!.&quot;</p><p>Uriah led the man toward the pews and noticed the Stranger examining the various frescoes and paintings that adorned the Church. Uriah smiled, the art of the church had long been something he had enjoyed and loved sharing with worshippers. Revelation pointed at a trinity of paintings that took up one of the walls &quot;Isandula Verona&apos;s work? I have not seen some of hers in many years&quot;</p><p>Uriah&apos;s face brightened &quot;It&apos;s been decades since someone recognized her work. One of my predecessors was gifted that piece after she attended one of his sermons&quot; The three paintings showed iconic scenes from the Church&apos;s creed. The first depicted nude figures within a utopian garden. The Second an epic duel between a Golden Knight and a Silver Dragon, and the last showed a being made of light surrounded by a mechanical halo.</p><p>The Stranger continued to state for a minute before he turned to the priest and spoke: &quot;Do you know what has been the fate of the grand churches and temples of Terra?&quot; Uriah eyed Revelations uniform and begin to wonder if this visit was more sinister in nature than he originally thought. The Old Priest sighed and spoke &quot;Yes, they have been destroyed by the Emperor and his legions. Is that why you have come? To destroy my Church like all the others have been?&quot; At that Revelations eyes seemed to lose all emotion and he spoke: &quot;Yes, but your council is required as well.&quot;</p><p>Revelation walked up to the altar and continued speaking &quot;Do you know how many Churches exist on Terra? How many Priests are left?&quot; Barely processing the news of his impending eviction and possible execution Uriah spoke &quot;A few hundred? A few thousand? Your Master has been through in his mission from what I hear.&quot; At that, a snort of derision escaped Revelation &quot;Only one of each remain.&quot; He gestured to Uriah and the building they were in &quot;The Last Church and the Last Priest of Terra&quot;</p><p>Uriah felt like a hammer blow had come down on his forehead. Could he truly be the Last Priest? Could all traces of faith be scoured from Humanity&apos;s Cradle this easily? A mixture of grief and anger filled Uriah&apos;s heart. In a bitter voice, he spat &quot;So what council could you possibly seek from me? You serve the regime that has more successfully extinguished the light of faith and salvation. What in the name Yeshua Crossed could you want from me?&quot;</p><p>Bitterness filled Revelations face as he spoke &quot;I want to know if I was wrong? I concluded that religion is a toxic dangerous thing a long time ago and time and again that conclusion has been reinforced by countless acts of insanity and zealotry I have witnessed.&quot; Rage filled Revelations face as he finished.</p><p>Letting out a defeated sigh he continued &quot;Yet despite that, new evidence has come to light. Evidence that no matter what is done humanity will seek something or someone to worship and that faith can be used. Used to protect against the darkness.&quot;</p><p>Uriah had met many atheists, agnostics, and naysayers throughout his career. There reasoning and believes varied and it was not atypical for him to encounter those attempting to refute his faith or rekindle their own. Revelation seemed to be both but not quite. He spoke more like a scientist questioning results than a tortured soul seeking solace in their own convictions or faith.</p><p>Uriah slowly approached Revelation and spoke, &quot;Tell me, my son, what has caused this change in your beliefs?&quot; The Old Priest was not just doing his duty as a man of the cloth but genuine curiosity. The stranger who had entered his Church was obviously a high ranking member of the Imperium. Someone who should sneer at the idea of religion and laugh at the idea that it was more than a narcotic for the masses. Yet shadows of doubt encircled Revelation and a curious thought occurred to Uriah.</p><p>This stranger spoke with such authority and without fear. Someone of his position should be terrified of being discovered anywhere near a place of worship not being sacked, let alone asking a Priest for advice. Obviously, Revelation was a person of great power and authority. Could his arrival be a sign from the Heavens that maybe the flames of faith were not yet doomed to be extinguished?</p><p>Revelation spoke to Uriah in a hushed whisper: &quot;I saw something, a vision.&quot; At this Uriah raised an eyebrow, such things were the domain of prophets and seers. Many of whom had been put to death by the Imperium. &quot;What did you see my child?&quot; &quot;I saw a future where the Emperor is worshipped as a god, where everything he stands for is perverted into a colossal theocratic nightmare where trillions of screaming fanatics live and die underneath the rule of the Immortal God Emperor of Mankind.&quot;</p><p>The words seemed to physically pain Revelation to speak but he continued. &quot;But the worst of it, the worst aspect of that nightmarish future where hope, reason, and logic were butchered in the name of dogma, zealotry, and oppression was that it worked. Humanity was truly united under the &quot;Imperial Creed.&quot; Faith protected against horrors beyond imagination, it fueled heroic acts and empowered the loyalist of mankind.&quot;</p><p>Revelation seemed to sag underneath some invisible burden and he slumped onto the front pew. The ancient wood groaned as if a dozen men had sat down instead of one. Uriah sat next to his guest and said softly &quot;I am no prophet nor psyker but I could predict such a vision perfectly.&quot; The Priest gestured around them as he spoke &quot;Humanity has sought to believe in a higher power for as long as we have existed. Believe offers both protection and answers to countless questions. It grants solace and if that solace is denied the yearning for it becomes simply greater.&quot;</p><p>At that Revelation snapped &quot;Yet I have given them exactly that. Protection from every evil and abomination to stalk the shadows. The Arts and Sciences are slowly returning to there former greatness to answer questions of both material and immaterial nature.&quot; A mixture of fury and questioning worry filled Revelations eyes. Uriah confused by the strange wording of Revelations outburst looked into his eyes, and was shocked at what he saw. Revelation looked no older than Forty standard years but his eyes were those of an ancient. Filled with centuries if not millennia of pain and knowledge.</p><p>Realization and shock filled the Old Priest as the truth dawned on him. The realization of his guest&apos;s identity. The Emperor of Mankind had come to seek his counsel. Rumors had abounded for years about the age and nature of the mysterious conqueror of Terra. The man who was equal parts Tyrannical overlord and Benevolent Leader.</p><p>Taking a deep breath Uriah gathered himself and continued &quot;Even if you offer alternatives to what religion offers and show the world all that is negative about it people will still desire it. Religion and Faith are as old as humanity, even during the heights of the Golden Age it still existed when nearly every evil and darkness in our species had been eradicated. It is not an evil thing, but just as corruptible as so much else of being human. Humanity needs to believe in a higher power and denying that will only lead to ruin.&quot;</p><p>The Emperor-in-disguise looked at Uriah and sadness filled his voice: &quot;You know who I am, I saw it within your mind when you realized the truth. No need to hide it, Uriah.&quot; Shutting his ancient eyes the Emperor continued &quot;You are wrong about one thing for certain, religion is not as old as humanity. I have lived for close to Fifty Thousand Years and I remember when the first cults and tribal religions rose.&quot; Slowly standing the Emperor walked up to the altar and stood at it like an expectant worshiper &quot;And the idea that religion is a constant is also wrong. I am responsible for its creation and it&apos;s only fitting I am responsible for its destruction.</p><p>Stunned silence filled the Church as Uriah processed the claim. Speaking softly the priest asked in a tone that was both incredulous and horrified &quot;Do you mean to say you founded my faith? That you founded humanities great religions and you see it as your duty to destroy them?&quot; A part of Uriah, a very large part wanted to dismiss the stranger&apos;s claims. To say he was a madman, a tyrant not an immortal who had walked the ages.</p><p>Yet something stopped Uriah, some instinctive feeling, some deep set ancestral memory locked within the human species. The mark on the human psyche left by the Emperor. Thousands of cultures throughout all of human history had tales of Mysterious Immortals, Wandering Gods, and Superhuman Monarchs. Every legend starts with a kernel of truth and something within Uriah told him the source of a million myths sat before him.</p><p>The Emperor let out a bitter laugh at Uriah&apos;s question. &quot;Yes, countless religions have sprung up in my footsteps. Sometimes intentionally sometimes not, but my sin is greater than inspiring a stray cult whenever I needed to take action. Humanities desire, no, need for a higher power to worship and follow is my fault.&quot;</p><p>Moving faster than the Priest could process The Emperor stood next to him and placed his palm on Uriah&apos;s forehead. Before anything could leave his lips golden light crashed into Uriah&apos;s mind and everything went white.</p><p>A Voice filled with power and wisdom echoed in Uriah&apos;s mind as he drifted through a psychically created void &quot;<strong>What is a god?&quot; </strong>Trying to get his bearings the stunned Uriah tried to speak: &quot;G-G-God is the creator and ruler of the universe and source of all moral authority; the supreme being.&quot; A deep chuckle answered that and the voice continued &quot;<strong>That is the textbook description of the deity of your faith. I ask you not what your god is but what is a god?&quot; </strong></p><p>After thinking for a second Uriah responded &quot;Something powerful, something beyond humanity. A supernatural being that is worshipped.&quot; To that the voice seemed to consider the answer given before speaking &quot;<strong>Understandable, Many beings fit your description and have indeed been worshipped as gods throughout human history. Even so Uriah, would you consider these beings fit to worship?&quot; </strong>Reality shifted again and Uriah found himself transported between countless realities. Each more horrifying than the last.</p><p>* A Titanic silver monster, with wings that blotted out the Sun and eyes burning with horrid green energy sat in an ancient temple desert temple where thousands of ancient humans kneeled before it awaiting their turn to be consumed by the Dragon from between the Stars. *</p><p>* Millions of Soldiers wearing incredibly advanced armor battling Billions of lobotomized corpses puppeteered by a world-sized Abominable Intelligence*</p><p>*A Godly Hive Mind that tainted and twisted all it touched. Manipulating and creating entire worlds of mutated dredges that prayed for their inevitable consumption and assimilation.*</p><p>*Shimmering bioluminescent Xenos indoctrinating world after world into becoming enthralled slaves who served their masters every whim till they were drained into desiccated husks.*</p><p>*Things made of nightmares and madness slithering out of cracks in reality to corrupt and control those desperate enough to seek it*</p><p>These and countless more nightmarish visages appeared before Uriah. Each traumatizing and sickening the priest more than the last. For a moment the kaleidoscope of monsters stopped. The Emperor&apos;s Voice spoke again &quot;<strong>Each of those abominations has claimed godhood. Each used humanities addiction to the divine to feed itself and enslave us. I have battled many of them and intend to cut the yoke of faith away so it may never divide us nor be used by our enemies.&quot;</strong></p><p>Fighting off panic attacks and the urge to vomit Uriah managed to speak: &quot;So that&apos;s your rationale? Humanity has been manipulated and controlled by countless things, why pick out Religion as your scapegoat and target of your ire?&quot; The White Space rumbled with the sound of distant thunder as the Emperor responded: &quot;<strong>The god-things I showed you use faith as a mean to a end. That is not the case with the Greatest Foes, the only Foe that matters. They do not use faith to control or manipulate but to grow in power and tear down the barriers between the real and the insane&quot; </strong></p><p>Four new visions appeared before Uriah at once. Four Storm of insanity and horror that swirled around him. Projections of a remembered vision muted for a mortals mind and still, they seethed with such corruption and cruelty that the Priest could feel it seeping into his very soul. Each of the monsters touched his soul. Leaving imprints of nightmares and all that is wrong with mortal kind upon his memory</p><p>The Hound Headed Bloody-Warrior showed visions of insanity and violence, where entire worlds were butchered in psychotic fury. A column of whispering smoke spoke of a trillion plots of betrayal and mutation. The unmistakable stench of rot filled Uriah&apos;s nostrils as a bloated corpse dribbled diseased poison disguised as love and acceptance. Last of the four was a vision of a great winged serpent that gorged itself upon its creators and sang a song of beauty and horror.</p><p>The quadra-fold monsters were each unique and horrible in their own way but Uriah recognized a similarity between all four. There Hunger, an unending painful hunger for more and more. Never content they each sought to corrupt and control everything they could. Uriah shuddered as he regained his surroundings and realized he had fallen to his knees within the Church. Looking up he saw the Emperor standing over him and he softly asked: &quot;What were those...things?&quot;</p><p>The Emperor looked off into the distant, ancient memories shrouding his mind as he spoke: &quot;The Great Enemy, the Four great beings of the Immaterium. Each claims godhood and mastery over the universe but like all things with them, That is a lie. The Immaterium is a realm where thought is given form and reality is subject to force of will. Those four are the sins and failings of all life made sentient and malicious.&quot;</p><p>Uriah slowly got to his feet and spoke &quot;So those things&#x2026; they feed upon worship and you seek to eliminate religion in order to cripple them?&quot; &quot;Not quite, they do feed upon faith but not it alone. Every and all activities that fall under their purview feeds them, but worship is more effective. For example, the so-called &quot;Architect of Fate&quot; is empowered by every plan ever made, but cults of sorcerers worshipping and serving it are a far greater source of energy to glut itself&quot;</p><p>Trying to rid his mind of the abominable sights and thoughts born of seeing the Four Uriah asked &quot;So why then? If they are going to keep feeding why eliminate all religions?&quot; To that, the Emperor quietly said: &quot;Religion offers them an opening. If people pray to the gods they hope for an answer. What do you think happens when the Four listen and answer their prayers?&quot; New visions then entered Uriah&apos;s mind to answer the Emperor&apos;s rhetorical questions.</p><p>*Entire Cities ripping themselves apart in sickening blood orgies.*</p><p>*Diseased Corpses rising from their graves to consume there friends and family.*</p><p>*Blasphemous rituals tearing open wounds upon reality allowing the substance of insanity to spill over the world in a tidal wave of damnation. *</p><p>Shuddering at the visions Uriah tried to stay standing, but his knees buckled finally under the psychological weight. The Emperor quickly caught the Priest and Uriah felt warm familiar energy enter his body and his legs could again support him. Still entranced by the saga being regaled to him Uriah asked the question that had been on his mind since before the visions the emperor had shown him. &quot;You said humanities need for faith is your fault. What do you mean?&quot;</p><p>A sadness darkened the Emperor&apos;s features as he summoned another vision to show Uriah. &quot;You are the Last Priest of the Last Church of Terra. I have deemed it fitting for you to hear my confession. None know this tale, not even my closest advisors and friends. You being the Last Priest it seemed only right for you to hear the story of the First Temple.</p><p>With that Uriah found himself transported to an arid badlands. Sand and stone stretched as far as the eye could see. Uriah looked up and was shocked. The sky was impossibly blue, and Sol hung high in the clear sky. &quot;Where are we?&quot; asked Uriah, as the shock of seeing the sky hit him. Appearing next to him the Emperor responded: &quot;Approximately thirty-five thousand years ago in a land, you know as the Achaemenid Empire.&quot;</p><p>As the Emperor spoke a lone figure appeared in the distance. The figure approached them and adjusted its ragged robes and Uriah saw its face. The Priest did a double take at the sight. The strange traveler was the Emperor, a younger barely two-decade-old Emperor by the look of it. Uriah pointed at the doppelganger and the Emperor explained before Uriah could say anything.</p><p>&quot;We are viewing my memories of this age. We are invisible witnesses to this saga of my youth.&quot; the twin watchers of the memory followed the young Emperor through the Desert. They trudged for miles as the Emperor of the present spoke: &quot;In my youth, I wandered Terra spreading knowledge and wisdom to the ancient tribes and early civilizations. Nothing to major just slight nudges to help technological and philosophical development.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I tried to never get too involved, not to let any group become reliant on my presence. My purpose has always been to guide and protect, humanity cannot be allowed to rely on me for it will weaken them.&quot; Uriah raised an eyebrow at that and asked &quot;Then why are you seeking to conquer and control humanity as its &quot;Emperor?&quot; A pained look crossed his face: &quot;Despite what you and many others might think I have no desire to rule. If there was another option than the Imperium, I would take it.&quot;</p><p>They crested a hill with the memory-form of the Emperor and before them nestled on the shore of a great sea was an ancient city. They and the memory-form stopped and admired the primitive metropolis. The Emperor continued his narration: &quot;I had not visited this city in about two and a half centuries. Last time I was here I helped treat a minor viral outbreak and explained a bit of basic hygiene. I had done similar across the world and thought nothing of it. So when I returned to this city nestled on the shore of the Salt Sea I was horrified by what I found&quot;</p><p>They followed the Memory-Form towards the city. Great processions of carts and beasts of burden carried goods towards the city gates. Each was stopped and tolled by a patrol of thuggish looking guards. The Ancient Emperor joined the line and eventually reached the gates. The Guards looked the shabby robed ancient up and down. &quot;Leave vagabond, we have no need for your kind here.&quot; The Ancient Emperor raised an eyebrow and began to motion with his hand before a voice popped up from behind him.</p><p>&quot;Uncle Ivram so that&apos;s where you wandered off to!&quot; A well-clothed man from the line approached and touched the Ancients shoulder. Calmly the man spoke to the guards: &quot;So sorry for that, my Uncle wandered away from the caravan.&quot; Pulling the Ancient Emperor away and directing him back to his family and servants the man continued in a whisper &quot;He is not quite right in the head, but I promised my father I would look after him&quot; The Guards grunted something in return.</p><p>Uriah and the Emperor followed the generous man and the Ancient. The Ancient Emperor quietly asked the stranger &quot;Why did you do this for me?&quot; The man shrugged his shoulders &quot;Kindness begets kindness, you are obviously not from around hear and it would be wrong to leave you out in the wilderness, especially on the day of the festival!&quot; The Ancient shook the man&apos;s hand and asked &quot;A festival? It seems I am just in time. You can call me Revelation by the way.&quot;</p><p>When the Ancient spoke his name Uriah swore he heard a thousand different words and names. Before he could ask the Emperor answered: &quot;People have long been curious about what my name is, never considering that Revelation is not an alias but how the human mind interrupts and translates it.&quot; The man unlike Uriah had a few hours or lifetimes ago did not respond to the strange name and simply said &quot;Nice to meet you Revelation, I am Lot Ur-Haran. You are just in time for the festival of the Four. It&apos;s our greatest event that celebrates the cities salvation by the gods!&quot;</p><p>The Ancient then followed Lot and spoke with him and his family as they moved up the line with there farm goods they sought to sell. The Emperor began to speak as they followed the group. &quot;At this point, small tribal faiths and city-state religions were not uncommon. Typically they worshipped nature in some form or another and my visions forecasted they would eventually die out as science and reason grew to explain the unexplainable.&quot;</p><p>The Ancient and Lots family finally entered the city and were soon greeted with the sound of great drums. Rhythms and song filled the entire city in a barely organized cacophony. The ramshackle streets were crowded with thousands. The Merchants and farmers peeled off from the line heading to various parts of the city to sell their goods. The Ancient simply followed Lot and watched. This was the largest city he had visited and marveled at the metropolis. Humanity was truly growing and preparing itself for its destiny.</p><p>Eventually, the Ancient thanked Lot and split off from his entourage of family and servants to explore the city. For hours he wandered and was both entranced and worried by what he saw. Great Kilns crafted pottery that was intricate in detail but grotesque in what it depicted. Scenes of bloodshed and debauchery were carved and stenciled upon them. Filth encrusted beggars wandered the streets pleading for spare food or currency, each seemed more broken and diseased then the last.</p><p>Eventually the Ancient heard the roar of a crowd above the cities other din and investigated as Uriah and the Emperor followed. Even though the dense scents of the city the Ancient could smell the distinct tang of blood in the air coming from the same place as the crowds shouting. Eventually the Ancient found the source. Dug out of the earth was a crude pit where hundreds of dredges clamoured at its edge to get a better view of its occupants.</p><p>With a slight bit of psychic suggestion, the Ancient pushed past the crowd and felt a cold fury fill him at the sight that awaited him. Two malnourished, manacled slaves savaged each other with crude bone blades as the crowd bayed for blood and gore. Shock filled the Ancients face as Uriah and the Emperor grimly looked on. Both of the observers had seen the worst of humanity during the Age of Strife and enslaved gladiators were just one of those horrors. Speaking softly the Emperor gestured to his younger self and said: &quot;this was the first time such an act was witnessed by us, sadly not the last though&#x2026;.&quot;</p><p>One of the slaves screamed with desperate rage and smashed his rivals skull into the stone wall of the pit over and over again. The losers blood and brains splattered out of the arena onto the cheering crowd as they chanted as one &quot;MAIM KILL BURN! MAIM KILL BURN! MAIM KILL BURN!&quot;</p><p>Disgusted and shook the Ancient quickly left the display and continued to wander the city. At each and every turn more atrocities met him. Horror and worry wormed deeper into the Ancient as he stumbled through the accursed city. What could have caused this? What was the source of this insanity?</p><p>Eventually, a familiar voice called to him &quot;Oh good to see you again Revelation!&quot; Lot along with his Wife and Daughters strode out of the crowd and greeted the Ancient. &quot;The Grand ritual of the Festival is about to begin! Care to come with us to it?&quot; Happy to see a friendly face the Ancient Emperor agreed.</p><p>Together they made it deeper and deeper into the heart of the city. Hear the drums and song was the loudest and the throngs of people become denser and denser. Eventually, they reached the Cities Great Ziggurat. Along with thousands of others, they ascended the Grand Staircase towards the highest point in the city. &quot;What is this place?&quot; asked the Ancient?</p><p>Seeming to puff up with pride Lot answered: &quot;The Great Temple of the Four, my forefathers helped lay the first stones for our great altar to the Gods!&quot; As they reached the top a great pyre was lit. Incense and smoke filled the air as the city crowded around the inner Temple. The Pyre marked the entrance to the temple and provided lighting and projected an aura of mystic upon the Grand Temple as the sunset.</p><p>Eventually, the Drumbeat increased in speed and it cued the thousands gathered to kneel as one before the pyre and Temple. Using a slight bit of warpcraft the Emperor stood standing while an illusion showed him kneeling like the rest. Uriah snorted at that &quot;Pride is a constant I do believe with you.&quot; The Emperor responded with an icy stare.</p><p>The Drumbeat came to a climax and stopped. Out of the temple in extravagant apparel came the High Priest and his inner circle. The High Priest stood before the altar and spoke in a booming voice: &quot;Generations ago our city was stuck with divine punishment for our Sin! Death and Doom stalked our lands and claimed whoever they liked. Countless wasted away and died under the weight of our blasphemy!&quot;</p><p>The Ancients eyebrows shot up, was this how they remembered the plague? Then how would they his intervention? The Priest continued &quot;Then the Stranger came! A prophet and Wiseman sent by the gods to lead us onto the path of righteousness! We were saved by his sacred wisdom and the gods in there eternal mercy spared us!&quot;</p><p>In an incredible display of controlled psychic power, the Ancient used a mix of Psychometry, Precognition and his own intellect to see into the past of the city. Both he and his watchers witnessed how a few corrupt few had twisted the tale story over the generations to better suit their master&apos;s needs&#x2026;</p><p>Something was obviously twisting this city and its people to its will. The Ancient had battled with Monsters and Nightmares from beyond this world or reality before but this was beyond anything he had seen. Except&#x2026; except for a few whispered memories from his predecessors</p><p>The High Priest continued &quot;Yet the Gods even with there mercy require assurance! The assurance that we will not fall into the old ways and fail this second chance! We sealed a covenant with the Four and we must prove our worthiness! We must sacrifice something precious to us in order to show our devotion!&quot;</p><p>With that, a keening wail erupted from the temple. As one eight women, each carrying an infant approached the altar. Disbelieve shuddered through both the Ancient and Uriah. Could the High Priest really intend to&#x2026;.?</p><p>The Women, know the mothers wore different expressions. Some were ecstatic, religious fervor enthralling them. Others appeared gaunt and dead-eyed, unwilling to accept what was about to occur. Only one sobbed and shook with fear and horror as she clutched her wailing infant to her breast.</p><p>As one they stepped up to the Altar and were ordered to hold their infants above the blazing pyre. The High Priest Raised a Blade carved from bone above his head and roared a jubilation to the gods &quot;Praise be to the Bloody Hound, The Rotting Toad, The Feathered Master of Schemes and the Serpent of Sin!&quot; With that, he brought his blade down on his other hand letting blood splatter out. At that gruesome signal, the Mothers dropped there infants into the roaring flames.</p><p>Prayers of adulation poured from the worshippers as the babies burned alive. The enthralled masses lacked the Ancients superhuman senses and could not hear or smell&#x2026; the sheer horror of what was occurring. The Ancient stood there his transhuman mine in shock at what he had just witnessed. Yet the atrocity was not yet over.</p><p>The weeping mother had not dropped her child and held it to her chest as she sobbed out desperate pleas for her child&apos;s life. With almost casual disdain the High Priest slit her throat and pushed her and the infant into the blaze. It was that action that ripped the Ancient Emperor from his stupor.</p><p>Time stood still for the Ancient and Uriah watched as reality slowed. Speaking with a mix of disgust and horror The Last Priest spoke: &quot;Ah, so that&apos;s why you blame yourself for this?&quot; With a voice as colder than nuclear winter, the Emperor responded: &quot;Not exactly, the monsters of the Warp used my actions against me, but my sin is what occurs next.&quot;</p><p>Time returned to its proper flow and the Ancient cast down the illusion of him kneeling and stood alone among the worshippers. Before the High Priest could screech at him for his disrespect and demand his execution the Anathema&apos;s wrath was unleashed. Warpfyre concentrated into a burst of psychokinetic plasma shot forth from the Ancients Golden eyes in a blast of raw energy that the likes would not be seen on earth until the next Volcanic eruption.</p><p>Instantly the Temple the Priests and the Altar were reduced to there subatomic elements. The Corrupted may have died instantly but their souls were denied from their Masters by the Flame that consumed them agonizingly. The Innocents were spared such a fate and simply became sheltered within the Oversoul of the Anathema. Yet the Ancient had been an age and an attosecond late. The Infants and the sacrificed mother were cast into the jaws of the Thirsting Gods.</p><p>Golden light erupted from the Ancient. Uriah felt the energy wash over him and his legs buckled. It was rawer, more ferocious and lacking the kindness of when it had healed him but the Energy was the same. The same as the divine light that had healed him and saved him at Gaduare. Slowly turning to the Emperor he spoke in hushed tones: &quot;You, it was you! You not only inspired my religion but my faith!&quot;</p><p>A somber look appeared on the Emperors face as he spoke &quot;Yes, you are not the first to find faith when exposed to my power. From twelve students, a Desert Merchant, The Slave Sage, and the Seventy Two Ascendant each found faith and started faiths under my influence in an attempt to stop things like this&quot; He gestured to the atrocity before them.</p><p>Snapping back to the memory they watched as the Ancient glowed with power beyond anything ever seen by mankind. Slowly the Anathema rose into the air and for a moment the citizens of the city looked at the psychic beacon and wondered if salvation or damnation had come to them.</p><p>The Ancient Emperor mustered his psychic might and brought something greater and more terrible than either forth. A wave of psychic might rolled off the Ancients body in a Psychic pulse that moved faster than thought across the Earth. Each and every human across the face of the Earth was touched by the tidal wave of Psychic Energy. As one every human touched by Chaos and the whispers of the warp died.</p><p>Like marionettes with there strings cut they simply collapsed. There mind shut down telepathically and there soul scoured or destroyed. Even those not corrupted felt the touch of the Anathema across their mind and learned without a shadow of a doubt that there is a higher power, something great, golden and powerful existed. The seeds of every messianic archetype, every king of the gods, every monotheistic deity had been planted.</p><p>Humanity had been touched by what many would call the divine and was forever altered by it. A shocked Uriah and a bitter Emperor watched as the Ancient slowly descended back to the temple ground and collapsed onto the ground. Every human being in a hundred kilometers lay dead. Two entire cities and countless villages and families had been stuck down for there sins. Every human that is for Lot and his family.</p><p>The Ancient slowly got to his feet, still shaking with shock and grief and looked at the four he had spared. He saw a horrific mix of fear and reverence in their eyes and in a psychic whisper said: &quot;Kindness begets kindness, run and don&apos;t look back.&quot; They complied and escaped the dead city as fast as they could. Trauma and religious visions filling their minds.</p><p>The Emperor and Uriah watched the Ancient sit there with his eyes shut and could see him trying to hold back tears over what he had done. The first great disaster in human history was by his hands, and he could feel the shockwaves of his actions change the future. The Warp had been thwarted in there attempt to corrupt early humanity but at what cost?</p><p>Uriah slowly turned to the Emperor and in a half, whisper said &quot;It all makes sense, you&#x2026; you are the source of faith and you created this need in humanity in your darkest hour.&quot; Sadness distorted the Emperor&apos;s noble features as he spoke: &quot;I lost control, for one second I lost control and this is what happened. Throughout the millennia I have tried to master and use this mistake to protect and help humanity. Yet no matter what I do, no matter what I say more and more atrocities occur&quot;</p><p>The Ancient eventually got to his feet after he sensed Lot and his Family were miles away. The Immortal held out his hands and in a feat of psychic power and control the likes off never scene he telekinetically triggered atomic fusion. A Blast of Nuclear fire erupted before him and consumed the city in a wall of death and fury. It was the first time but most certainly not the last that the being that would eventually be known as the Emperor of Mankind would burn away the taint of chaos.</p><p>As the wall of nuclear plasma engulfed them the vision faded and the watchers stood within the Last Church once again. The Emperor seemed emotionally drained and slumped onto one of the pews. Uriah shakily joined him and they sat there in shocked silence for hours. Eventually, in a cracking voice, Uriah spoke: &quot;You are right, religion is a mistake.&quot;</p><p>Slowly heaving himself to his feet Uriah continued speaking as he walked up to churches Altar &quot;But there is a way, humanity needs something to have faith in, to believe in. Give them something to believe in and sate there need until humanity is ready to know the truth.&quot; Almost casually Uriah picked up a guttering candle from the altar and dropped it upon the moth-eaten rug of the Church.</p><p>Fire began to spread quickly, the ancient building began to burn as Uriah and the Emperor stared at each other. &quot;Go on then, the Last Church must burn like the First and I must go with it,&quot; spoke Uriah in a hoarse whisper. With a somber calmness, the Emperor got to his feet and stood before Uriah. The Priest shut his eyes and awaited his end.</p><p>It did not come, instead, golden energy flared and the emperor cast aside his illusionary form and stood before Uriah in his full glory. With surprising delicacy, the Emperor brought his armored hand to the Last Priests forehead. Golden energy filled Uriah&apos;s body and soul. He could feel his body healing from a thousand different ailments brought on by time and a hard life. In turn, his soul was purified from the touch of the Four and became armored against them.</p><p>In a voice that commanded armies and ordered the building of empires he spoke &quot;<strong>Uriah Olathaire, you are wise for a man of so few years. I will not let you burn and be forgotten like the faiths of old. You are to come with me into this future. The Shining Path is narrow and you will help me keep our species upon it</strong>&quot;</p><p>The Emperor of Mankind then turned and left the Church with the newly ordained Guardian of Truth. Together they watched the Last Church of mankind burn to the ground. Uriah then asked simply as what once was his home became ash and dust &quot;So what now?&quot; The Emperor was stony-faced as he responded: &quot;<strong>We have a species to save.&quot;</strong></p><p>(A.N. Sorry this took so long. Its size coupled with a minor accident I suffered that put me out of commission for a bit are why there was such a massive delay. I am thinking chapter ten will be shorter so hopefully not nearly as long of a wait. Hope you all enjoy!)</p>
