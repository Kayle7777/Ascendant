<p>Chapter Fourteen: Tales from the Palace and Beyond (First Half)</p><p>Part I: The Haunting of the Imperial Palace</p><p>Three Months after the Emperor left for Mars.</p><p>It started small at first, strange shadows, whispers in the dark, night terrors among the menials. To the residents of the Imperial Palace nothing was wrong, just more grist for the rumor mill ever present among servants. Stories of ghosts and monsters wandering the halls late at night and doing unspeakable things to those unlucky enough to be caught by them. This all changed when the first body was discovered.</p><p>Deaths were not uncommon within the palace, from natural, accidental or violent causes. So normally a corpse showing up in an inner palace construction site might warrant a senior Arbities investigation or even a Custodes involvement if it was close enough to a place of importance. This was an anything but normal case.</p><p>Gotfiar Yeon had been an upstanding and loyal servant of the Imperium and no amount of digging revealed anything about him that made his fate seem in any way just. The construction foreman for Mid-palace construction zone 491-12.1 was found gruesomely butchered and displayed in his former work site.</p><p>His skin had been flayed and stretched into a horrific banner of pain. 74% of his bones had been broken into new and distorted positions and blood splatter could be found in a nearly fifty feet radius of the body. Yet arguably worse of all, his face had been perfectly unharmed by the actions and he was easily recognizable to his friends and colleagues who discovered him. The expression he wore was one of utter primal terror that rigor mortis had stretched taught.</p><p>The brutality and dramatic nature of both death and body display almost instantly caught the attention of a multiple Imperial Agencies all trained to watch for markers of Chaotic Activity. The Emperor had been extremely thorough in his destruction of Terra&apos;s taint but being too thorough is an impossibility when dealing with the Great Enemy.</p><p>Eyes of both Malcador and the Emperor soon swarmed the crime scene and despite the finest minds and equipment, the Imperium had to offer no answers could be found. It was almost as if the shadows themselves had killed the poor man. The Investigation was still in full swing when the second murder occurred. It did not stop there, every few days the increasingly worried Agents of the Imperium would receive new reports and still were no closer to their goal. Soon the murders seemingly committed by no one started whispers of a ghost within the palace.</p><p>Every few days another random individual, from menial to High-adept was plucked away and butchered. Inhabitants of the place started to report sightings of what they described as &quot;Living shadows&quot; stalking the palace and sightings increased shortly before or after an incident. The palace was in a constant state of turmoil and the Custodes hunted the being that dared to defile their masters home. Little did they or anyone else know the source of the horrors slept badly deep within the Inner Palace.</p><p>Ever since his Father had left the regularity and intensity of Konrad Cruze&apos;s nightmare increased. Soon the Eighth son of the Emperor was turned into a gaunt wreck of himself, sleep deprivation and trauma were taking their toll. His performance in academics started to slip but his combat performance actually improved, yet in disturbing ways. Konrad was no longer the calculating master of shadows but an ugly terror-inducing gutter fighter.</p><p>His brothers attempted to help in their own ways. Tyric, Kalib, and Magnus all independent of each other snuck into his quarters to place wards against evil spirits, witches, and the warp respectively. It worked for a while but eventually, they burnt out from the phenomenon&apos;s intensity.</p><p>So far the only being capable of stopping the Nightmares was Konrads Father, in The Emperor&apos;s absence, his Matrari attempted to use her powers to help. Theresa Nellie was one of the most powerful Empaths ever discovered. She could not just feel emotions of others but manipulate them on a massive scale. Nellie had been enslaved from a young age by a minor Terran Warlord, since the day of her kidnapping she had plotted the tyrant&apos;s downfall.</p><p>Slowly she magnified the negative emotions of her captives lieutenants to drive each and everyone insane or lose their masters favor. Theresa&apos;s actions had weakened the Warlord enough that the still young Imperium could conquer the fiefdom. At first, she prepared to do the same to the oncoming Legion. Yet when she saw the Man at the lead of the army she realized what was coming was not just another form of damnation, but salvation carrying a thunderbolt.</p><p>In an act of vengeance for all she had been forced to do and for her family butchered at the Warlords hands she magnified his sense of guilt a few billion times over. The once cruel grasping tyrant ordered his strongholds defenses lowered. He ran out the front gate blubbering like an infant and begged for death. His request was granted and Theresa had been recruited by Malcador and eventually was chosen for her position due to her powers being able to effectively counter some of Konrads if they went haywire.</p><p>So far she had limited success and managed to keep Konrad relatively sane and stop his psychic powers from driving have the menial staff of the inner palace mad with fear. Now simply whatever was butchering them was. The Nightmares got only worse as time went on and the murders more frequent and brutal.</p><p>Eventually, Malcador realized there had to be some sort of connection between the nightmares Konrad refused to speak of and the murders. He had seen the memories of the broken evil thing that the Four had intended to twist him into and the crimes being committed stunk of that Cruze. The Sigillite did not want to consider it but he must, it was becoming increasingly likely that this Cruze was more akin to his counterpart then thought possible.</p><p>Malcador requested an Ephori Custodes keep secret watch over Konrad Curze. Soon a particularly masterful walker of shadows stalked the Emperor&apos;s Eighth son with none the wiser. After a week or two sightings of the ghost reached an all-time high and the Watcher prepared for whatever would come. The next morning the Primarch Quarter was awoken by screaming.</p><p>They found Konrad curled into a ball in one of his apartments halls. He was slick with blood and the Ephori lay twitching in a puddle of his ichor that was smeared onto the Eighth Son. Despite his Matarai and his brother&apos;s protests, Konrad was spirited away to some of Malcadors secret chambers and the body was investigated.</p><p>The Custodes had died much cleaner than the others, the hallway showed the reasons. He had dueled something and lost. It had not been an execution like the others but a battle. As Konrad waited under guard from a full complement of Palace Guards and Custodes. Malcador, the three of the five Tribunes on terra and Arik Taranis watched the helm footage of the Custodes. He had been a diligent servant of the Emperor and recorded the entire fight, and when he realized he was outmatched prioritized footage quality over his own survival.</p><p>They watched as the Custodes rushed from his hiding place to the door outside of Konrad&apos;s quarters. Secretly placed sensors both arcane and otherwise had been triggered and they watched through his eyes as a pool of oily shadow oozed out from under the door.</p><p>It noticed the Custodes and turned into a mass of blades and smoke. The Custodes barely had time to block and was slowly peeled apart by the supernatural thing. The touch of the warp prevented his call from help and the Custodes resigned to his faith and prepared to die protecting the Emperor&apos;s sons. The fight finished and the shadow lurched forward for the kill and between the folds of shadow and smoke, Malcador saw something that sent a chill down his aged spine.</p><p>Peering out from the creature&apos;s heart was a face, a horribly familiar face. Its hair was black and matted with gore, the skin was waxy and dead looking. Each tooth looked jagged and fang-like and its eyes&#x2026; by the Lightning Bolt, its eyes were the dead black of an ancient Carcharodon. It was a face of a forgotten future, it was the Konrad Curze of Nostromo.</p><p>The custodes was impaled and then slowly slid off the creatures blade/arms as it looked on with a sickening grin. Suddenly like a flickering hololith, it faded from being and shortly after a wild-eyed child-Konrad entered the hallway and fell to his knees in horror. Softly Malcador said &quot;I have seen enough, we must go to Konrad&quot;</p><p>With an irate Theresa in tow, they joined the sobbing Konrad and Theresa ran to the blood-soaked child and held him as Malcador quietly approached. Malcador took a dataslate form a servant and pulled up the image of the other Cruze. He set it before the shaking child and asked gently &quot;Do you know who that is?&quot;</p><p>A mix of fear, guilt, hate, and misery passed through the young Primarch and with a trembling voice said: &quot;He said he will kill you all if I tell him, that while father is gone none can stop him.&quot;</p><p>Placing a soft hand on Konrad&apos;s shoulder Malcador used his own formidable power to ease the child&apos;s heart and pulsed Theresa to do the same. The Sigillite continued &quot;Your Uncle Malcador has seen and done a lot over the Millenia. The thing that is scaring you is a lie given form. It hides and ambushes those weaker than it. It barely won against a single Custodes and tried to avoid that battle. That thing can do nothing to me, your brothers or Theresa. You have my word we&apos;ll stop it from hurting anyone else.&quot;</p><p>Calming down slightly Konrad took a deep breath and said in a shuddering whisper &quot;He came to me in dreams after Father left, I had dreamt about him before but it had been liking watching a Pictcast, this&#x2026; this was really being with him. He said he was me, what I was going to become. He said I was going to become him, the Night Haunter&quot;</p><p>Malcador was both relieved and horrified. Konrad was not born a monster but one had latched onto his soul and was hard at work corrupting him. If this being was truly what it claimed and what Malcador feared, then it would be difficult to dislodge. Konrad was taken back by Theresa to clean up and rest for the coming ordeal. The Imperial Palace was indeed haunted, haunted by a ghost of futures prevented. Now it was the duty of the Lord Sigillite to exorcise it.</p><p>A week later after vigorous preparation, Malcador returned with Eight heavily armored women who caused shivers to dance along the spine of any who got to close. These were not the Sisters of Silence, but the seeds that would grow into that mighty order. Konrad had been kept in a medicated coma for most of the week. Malcador had correctly deduced the apparition was connected to the young Primarchs dreams. The drugs used kept him from dreaming and Theresa sat by his bedside night and day soothing his transhuman mind as much as her considerable powers allowed.</p><p>Malcador entered flanked by the Eight Women and Theresa nearly jumped out of her chair and scrambled to put herself in front of her adopted child. Her psychic nature told her exactly what the Women were and she assumed the worse. &quot;Do not hurt him Malcador! I swear on Konrads Father I will hound you to ends of the galaxy if you dare unleash&#x2026; THEM on him&quot;</p><p>The Women looked at each other a mixture of dark amusement and resignation to there nature flickered over there stoic faces and Malcador spoke. &quot;Calm yourself, my dear, they are here to protect not destroy. I do not know how strong the Warp phenomena will be and want to keep everyone safe.&quot;</p><p>Theresa Nellie relaxed at that and asked the loaded question that had plagued her for a week &quot;What&apos;s going on and what do you intend to do?&quot;</p><p>Somberness spread across Malcadors face as he explained. &quot;A warp entity of remarkable power has latched onto his soul, I can not tell you the details for his safety but this being possesses a power link to Konrad within the Warp and has used him as a gate to enter our realm.&quot;</p><p>Theresa&apos;s eyebrows rose as she responded &quot;I thought even the most Psychically active Primarchs were protected from such things? The soulbond and their father&apos;s blood should protect them. How is this occurring?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Like I said this being possesses an incredible psychic bond with him and its peculiar nature allowed it to slip past the protections.&quot;</p><p>Malcador privately thought &quot;It always seems to be the loophole, the webway project could survive the full might of the Four but not a Primarchs. The Primarchs warding could keep out any taint except them&#x2026;&quot;</p><p>Continuing to Theresa Malcador spoke: &quot;This being must be exorcised to save him. I possess the power to do so but I fear it would damage him. It would be like setting fire to a building to drive out the vermin. So another solution must be reached.&quot;</p><p>He walked up to the sleeping child and placed a hand on his forehead. &quot;I will empower him to cast it out. The Emperor made it very clear anything done to the Primarch in his absence requires both mine and their Matrari&apos;s consent. Do you?&quot;</p><p>Frowning for a split second she quickly responded: &quot;You are held in the Emperor&apos;s highest trust so you are in mine well.&quot;</p><p>Malcador nodded softly and reached into the Primarchs mind. A bit of biomancy removed the drug&apos;s effects, he needed to dream for this. Soon Malcador found himself somewhere dark, a filthy shadowy place he recognized from data slates long ago and the Emperor&apos;s future memories. Malcador was on Nostromo: The Dark World.</p><p>He heard a slight noise and the wizened psyker strode down the streets encrusted with blood, piss, and excrement to the source of the sound. Malcador recognized it soon as a child crying and soon found a filthy child hiding in a dark alley. He recognized the features and realized the urchin covered in grime was Konrad Curze. The child looked up at him and Malcadors blood ran cold. This was not his Konrad.</p><p>Grinning sadistically a thing made of knives and shadows started to peel out of the child&apos;s skin. A wet giggle escaped its throat as it loomed over Malcador &quot;My, my dear Fathers favorite pet comes a calling! Where is the old...older man anyway? Loose his spawn again or abandon them for the good of humanity?&quot;</p><p>Malcador mustered his psychic will and shielded himself from the beings corrosive power before responding harshly &quot;You know as well as I do you only dared to rear your feted head with him off world. Ever the coward aren&apos;t you Cruze?&quot;</p><p>The Thing chuckled mirthlessly &quot;Oh I am not Konrad, he is long gone. He took the assassin&apos;s blade in a pitiable attempt to earn forgiveness. Me, I took the blade to vindicate what we had always said. That the Imperium was made by murder and despite its lofty goals would still need us or things like us.&quot;</p><p>Snarling softly Malcador raised his staff and let it flair with power as spoke &quot;So the rumors were true, this planet broke you into two. Konrad Curze rests with that Emperor&apos;s light. It is time to send the Night Haunter back to the pit it belongs&quot;</p><p>Before the first blows could be struck a blast of dust and silver exploded before them, the Night Haunter recoiled and a hand pulled Malcador away from it. The old man could barely keep up with the frantic child who pulled him through side streets until they reached a filth stained version of Konrad&apos;s room in reality. Malcador had been brought into the Eight primarchs hiding place within his own mind.</p><p>The frantic child started speaking impossibly quickly &quot;UNCLE MALCADOR YOU CAN&quot;T BEAT HIM NOTHING WORKS HE JUST COMES BACK THE NIGHT HAUNTER ALWAYS COMES BACK&quot;</p><p>Malcador calmed the child and said, &quot;Yes you are correct Konrad I cannot defeat him, but you can.&quot;</p><p>Konrad was dumbstruck before Malcador continued &quot;That thing is a parasite latched onto your mind. It is powerful but it is your mind and you control it. Right now you are too young and inexperienced to beat it. Yet I am old and experienced. I will give you all the tools needed to remove it and you will save yourself, Konrad.&quot;</p><p>Panic and confusion momentarily blossomed over the Eight Primarchs face but he was his Father&apos;s son and resolution soon filled him. Nodding slowly he agreed and Malcador placed his hand on Konrad&apos;s forehead. A Blast of energy shook the dreamscape and where once had stood a young Konrad and an elderly Malcador was a single being. A Primarch in his prime empowered by ancient knowledge. A future Konrad Cruze, the Primarch of the Shadow Scions came into being.</p><p>The form was created from a mix of Konrad&apos;s own dreams, Malcadors foresight and the Emperor&apos;s ideal. If the Nighthaunter was the worst the Eighth Primarch could be, then this was the best. Konrad piloted the dream-form and was shocked by the countless techniques and powers available to him from Malcadors mind. Konrad did not know this but the Grand Master of Assassins had millennia ago earned that future title not simply in loyalty and authority, but wetwork skills.</p><p>Now two Primarchs, one form the best future and one from the worst stood across from each other. A King of the Night versus a Nightmare given flesh. In a dreamscape of a Nostromo alley, two demigods batteled. Monofilament blades filled the air, crackling talons shredded armor and flesh. They both held psychic mastery of the darkness, and it seemed the very night itself battled over who would be its rightful master.</p><p>For hours and seconds, they ripped at each other with countless weapons both mental and physical. The Night Haunter spat insults, curses and taunts the entire while. &quot;Your Father will cast you aside like he did us! You are already broken, and he has no use for broken tools! I am going to crawl out of your skin and force feed that mother dearest of yours her own entrails! Everyone knows the tragedy of poor Konrad Curze, how he was too weak and let his inner Demons swallow him whole, now it&apos;s time for a second meal!&quot;</p><p>Konrad remained silent the entire fight as sparks flew and blood splattered across the increasingly ruined alleyway. They were evenly matched, neither side could gain an advantage and it seemed the fight was doomed to end with Konrad cracking under the strain of wielding a mixture of his and Malcadors power. Suddenly a thought from Malcador whispered a path to victory.</p><p>Running low he clinched his doppelganger and simply whispered a simple phrase into the broken things face. &quot;There was another way, you just had to try.&quot;</p><p>The Night Haunter looked like a lighting claw had been driven into it with those words. A moment later two had been. The split second was all it took for Konrad to impale the monster and start to shred it apart. The Eighth son spat into the Night Haunters face and said &quot;You are a sad, pathetic thing, bound by strings of fate easily cut and unable to become what you were meant to be. The Night Haunter of Nostromo is dead, you hold no power over me. Be gone from here filth&quot;</p><p>The Night Haunter started to shatter like burnt glass on Konrads Claws and the fading monster rasped. &quot;I have a message from the four to father.&quot;</p><p>Malcador snarled internally, of course, they were behind this. The Night Haunter was never a favored servant of there&apos;s but after being ripped away from the original Curze this more twisted version of the Eight Primarch found a place within the great game.</p><p>The Quickly cracking Night haunter gave the message &quot;We have claimed countless of your spawn, Anathema. One universe of temporary salvation will fall before the infinites of damnation.&quot;</p><p>With that, the Night Haunter exploded into black glass with a psychotic laugh and was banished. Malcador and Konrad separated. The Child was stunned but confident. The monster that stalked his mind was banished. He had beat it once, he could beat it again. Malcador placed a hand on Konrad&apos;s shoulder and pulled them both back into reality. On the way, Malcador tweaked Konrad&apos;s memory. Somethings were best left forgotten and others were not for Konrad to know yet.</p><p>They both awoke back into the med-room and the Eight Blanks went to immediate battle stations. With a gesture in thought-mark, they were put at ease. Konrad awoke to find Theresa passed out next to his bed. He gently shook her awake and she embraced him with tears in her eyes. When she asked what happened Konrad simply smiled and said &quot;I beat the Monster, it&apos;s gone. He won&apos;t hurt anyone again&quot;</p><p>Malcador left the duo with the Sisters and watched the 19/20 other Primarchs pile into the room to check in on their sibling. Over the next few months, Konrad would grow leaps and bounds into one of the greatest of his brothers. His Daemons were banished and the King of the Night was poised to take his throne. Yet new worries wracked the Sigilites aged bones. The Four were plotting, they may have saved these heroes-to-be but other fallen princes of the Imperium awaited to fulfill the will of thirsting gods</p><p>Part II The Humbling of the Mage.</p><p>Five Months after the Emperor left for Mars.</p><p>Arik Taranis leaned his massive bulk against the banister and was pleasantly surprised it didn&apos;t groan in protest. The Primarchs accommodations, where he now stood were one of the few places he did not need to watch his every move to ensure he did not leave it a ruin. The Emperor had not gifted him and his fellow prototypes with the same level of micro-motor skills that next generations of enhanced warriors possessed. They had been built as destroyers, Gods of Destruction crafted to burn away the ruins of humanities fallen empire so a new one could rise. Things such as fine motor skills, stable Hypno-indoctrination, and their lifespans had been sacrificed for raw power.</p><p>Arik felt little ill will towards his creator for it, he had seen exactly how far humanity had fallen during the Old Night and had helped haul it back from the edge of extinction kicking and screaming. Taranis knew how close humanity had come to the end and if the Emperor waited just a little longer there might not have been a species to save. Being created flawed seemed a small price to pay.</p><p>Even so, they were far beyond a normal human but lacking compared to the Primarchs he watched train below him. Arik himself being closer to the Primarchs was still far far above the Astartes Baseline but it did not come naturally to him. He had to watch his every movement in more fragile environments. These thoughts drifted through the old champion&apos;s mind as he viewed the combat drills performed below. He stood on an observation deck overlooking a section of the Imperial Palaces training grounds.</p><p>He had passed through the Legion Yards and seen the adolescent Astartes being drilled in countless martial and tactical skills by Ghota and a handpicked group of Unification Wars Vets. His last surviving son had taken to his role of Drill instructor well and had often referred to the legions as the &quot;piss-brained limp wristed mutts with potential&quot;</p><p>That was the closest he could easily come to praise for the Astartes. To both Arik and Ghota, they had at first seemed lacking. Not strong enough, not fast enough, not vicious enough, nothing compared to the Thunder Warriors glory. That was until they saw the Legio Astartes fight as they were meant too. Not as warriors or even soldiers but as Armies.</p><p>The Thunder Warriors were known by that epitaph instead of their title due to them being true Warriors, the Legion organization of them was more for easier management than an actual command structure. They fought side by side but individually. Not so much an army but a group of monsters rampaging together.</p><p>Malcador had once after observing a series of duels between Custodes and Thunder Warriors made a comparison that would be often used. &quot;The Thunder Warriors are like great Ursine-beasts. Existing only in bored hibernative stupors during peace and vicious forces of destruction during war. By comparison, the Custodes are Alpha-Felines. Regal, Terrible, Apex Predators, meant to be perfect in every conceivable way&quot;</p><p>Arik grudgingly agreed with the assessment and viewed the Astartes as being the third part of this Transhuman trinity. If the Thunder Warriors were Bears, the Custodes Lions then the Astartes were Wolves. Easily broken by a lazy strike from their predecessors but worked as a pack capable of wearing down and ripping the first two apart.</p><p>As the years of training had gone on Ghota had expressed concern to Arik that these wolves were just that, not hounds and negligible to bite the hand that feeds. Conversations with the Boss and Malcador had made it evident to the Lighting Bearer that was indeed a great concern and they were betting on the wolves doing what wolves do: follow the Alpha.</p><p>The Alphas in question were dueling within reinforced Practice Cages below Arik. Part of the Primarchs training involved daily duels against each other to foster both martial skill and camaraderie between them. Each day they were randomly divided up into dueling pairs, (Alpharius and Omegon flipped a coin or some days fought together.) and fought under certain conditions chosen to keep them adaptable and skilled in things other than their specialty.</p><p>Sometimes they fought with just hands and feet, other times engaging in running gun battles. Today they fought with a weapon of their choosing and nothing else. No warp born power, no physical gifts, no hidden weapons or alchemical concoctions. Just steel and grit.</p><p>This suited some fine, it annoyed a few but only one Primarch was openly contemptuous of this particular challenge: Magnus. Taranis watched the crimson haired Primarch duel his older brother Eddard. Arguably the greatest martially of the Primarch, Eddard combined elements of the skill of Iskandar, the physicality of Vulkan, Tyric&apos;s ferocity and the twins X-factor into what even Arik had to admit would probably be the greatest warrior humanity had ever seen. He was losing badly.</p><p>To a casual observer, it would seem Eddard was simply losing to a superior warrior. His guard was just an instant too slow or his blade lacked the power to properly damage his sibling. Arik knew the truth, centuries of battling things not meant to be had given him a good nose for detecting the Warps touch. He had to admit Magnus&apos;s skill at it was flawless. Somehow without any detection, he was dilating time to the smallest degree for both him and his brother. Making himself an instant faster and Eddard an instant slower.</p><p>A faint distortion of the air around the pair was the only indication and was not visible to unaugmented eyes. This along with what Arik was fairly certain was impressively subtle biomancy if the slight ozone-twinge to Magnus&apos;s scent was any indication gave him a considerable edge over his brother. The battle had been going on for a minute or so and it amused Arik to notice the shift that overcame Eddard when he realized his brother was not going to stop and this was not some secret test but Magnus cheating.</p><p>Eddard did not burn with a vicious fury like Tyric, Culain or Kalib. When he got angry he became focused but much more vicious than his more fiery siblings. His Matrari had once compared it to a laser that seared through whatever had gained his ire. Now that white-hot intensity scorched at Magnus.</p><p>The Young Lion as he was so often called started to push his body and mind to its absolute limit. No longer caring about martial precision or even his guard Eddard switched to a combat style taught to him by a Fallen Sword-Saint of Gredbritton. It was a supremely offensive style that sacrificed all defensive stances and measures for a devastatingly effective battle-trance that defended by simply making it so the opponent could not attack.</p><p>Even with the Mages multiple advantages, he was starting to be pushed back. Magnus was forced to stop lashing out with the bladed edges of his Zhen-Staff and focus on simply keeping Eddards longsword away from him. That was his mistake, his weapon was designed to keep his foe away from him while he cast spells. Being forced to block meant his foe was far closer than he should be.</p><p>Eddard did not stop, he continued to wail into his brother with focused passion. Magnus could only slow the pace he was being forced back by the flurry of blows. Arik sensed the time dilation increase but it was too little too late. Magnus was backed into one of the cages corners and his confident exterior started to crack. Eddards blade seemed to be in multiple places at once and soon the mage&apos;s armor was checkered with the electric burn marks indicating Eddard&apos;s sword had made contact.</p><p>Letting loose an angry scream Magnus gambled on a lunge that on the battlefield would take virtually anything head off. Eddard was not anywhere near where the spade-shaped end of the double-edged staff was stabbed. It took Magnus a second to realize his brother had jumped a few feet straight into the air and was now descending like the predatory Jungle-Cats he was often compared too.</p><p>Even Arik had to admit it was a masterful bit of misdirection leading to a great killing blow. Eddard landed on the Zhen-Staffs shaft and pinned it to the floor while bringing his longsword down onto the joint where Magnus&apos;s Cuirass and Gorget met. The combination of Transhuman muscle and gravity should have let the dull buzz-blade rip through the protective armor and severely bruise if not fracture Magnus&apos;s collarbone. It should have been a definite kill strike. Emphasis on should.</p><p>While the blade was just a few inches from his neck Magnus had blurted out an incantation, a small flash of light filled the practice cage and Eddard was left to stare at his blade in a mix of annoyance and surprise. The blade had been changed by Magnus&apos;s magic and became rubbery and elastic. The Longsword now lay drooped over his brother&apos;s shoulder like a length of rope. Seeing the jig was up Magnus blossomed with power and knocked his sibling back with a telekinetic wave. Eddard quickly sprang to his feet and was met by the Zheng-Staffs kopsheh blade to his throat.</p><p>With his own sword flopping uselessly in his hand the First Primarch&apos;s eyes narrowed in vicious fury as he spat out the words he despised about all &quot;I surrender&quot;</p><p>Grinning foolishly Magnus lowered his own weapon and was about to start speaking before a mailed fist pummeled into his face. The Fifteenth Primarch went sprawling and Eddard was on top of him. His composure had been compromised and he ripped into Magnus. The Arena-attendants that had been monitoring the fight were unsure what to do and did not want to get between the two. Arik could have easily dropped down and ended the fight but decided he could wait a minute or two.</p><p>Eddard roared into his brothers face &quot;DID YOU SEE MY BLADE IGNITE IN WHITE FIRE? DID MY FLESH GLOW WITH PSYCHIC MIGHT? I SHUT OFF EVEN MY WARRIOR-INSTINCTS! YET YOU FLAUNTED YOUR POWERS AND ACTED HONORLESS!&quot;</p><p>Another bone-crushing wave of energy smashed into Eddard, sending him tumbling back. The snarling First Son clambered to his feet. Arik could feel the Older Primarch mustering his own warp-gifts along with his considerable mental and physical fortitude in order to strike back. Soul-Fyre started to crackle in his hands and he let psychic energy pour into his muscles to enhance him. Right now Eddard stood as a paragon of what a Primarch could be. A bonding of humanities mastery over both physical and spiritual crystallized into a young hero. He never stood a chance.</p><p>Each of the Primarchs was connected to the Warp and could wield formidable psychic powers both consciously and unconsciously. Some could manipulate the minds of lesser beings, others enhance their body or mind past its already transhuman limits. Both the Emperor and Malcador had educated them in the use of these gifts and all of them could control an wield them. Yet one stood above the rest in sheer power. Magnus now used that power to utterly subjugate his brother.</p><p>Eddard had barely made a few steps towards Magnus before a psychic wave that would have stripped the flesh from a mortals bones smashed him into the far wall of the practice cage. He was held aloft in the dent his body had made in the Cages bars. Magnus floated to his feet and hovered towards his brother, all while increasing the pressure on him.</p><p>Psychic energy bled from the Mages eyes as he trembled with fury. Eddard&apos;s composure had cracked earlier, and his focused anger had become a primitive vicious fury. Now Magnus&apos;s composure was compromised and a mercurial coldness poured off of him as he spoke.</p><p>&quot;You surrendered. I won and then you still attacked me. Where was that honor you aspire to brother? You lost and then you attacked me for being better than you. I&apos;m ashamed for you Eddard.&quot;</p><p>Arik could only gap in mild shock. Was this brat really that arrogant? He had been a few years dealing with a few minor uprisings and he had returned to Magnus being a right little snotling. At first, he had intended to only watch but now he knew a bit of Uncle Arik&apos;s &quot;guidance&quot; was in order. Eddard, in turn, responded the best he could with nearly fifty g&apos;s on his chest &quot;A-a-are you&#x2026;. Serious? Mag-g-gnus you cheated with yuuurr powers and beesmurched the arena.&quot;</p><p>Magnus scoffed and responded &quot;Father gifted you with steely muscles and reflexes capable of catching bolt-shells. Just as he gifted me with the powers of the warp. You are using your gifts just as I was using mine.&quot;</p><p>Before Eddard could respond a few hundred kilos of Thunder Warrior landed between the brothers. One massive meaty paw grabbed Magnus by his long red mane and slammed him into the floor and the other caught the limp Eddard. The Impact had knocked the Fifteenth son out and the First slurred something that sounded like &quot;I had it under control&quot; before fading into unconsciousness.</p><p>Sighing to himself Arik hoisted the two juvenile Demi-gods over his shoulders and left the practice chamber. Up close he found the strange proportions of the Primarchs more amusing. He had been spat out of a vat fully grown and the other enhanced warriors followed a slightly altered maturing process, but not Primarchs. The Little bastards were physically and mentally children but lacked the weird proportions of them. They looked like miniature Astartes and he could understand why The Emperor had psychically bonded the Assai-Matrari with the tykes. Transhuman-dread inspiring children was no laughing matter.</p><p>Cracking his neck Arik left the training grounds with the two primarchs. The other duels lulled at the sight of him. Kota broke a clinch with Moric and clambered onto the cage wall and called out &quot;Uncle Arik! You&apos;re back! Uhh please don&apos;t kill them&#x2026;&quot;</p><p>The old warrior simply chuckled and waved to his gene-kin. He deposited Eddard into the Mediace ward and explained the situation. The squadron of tutors and mentors started devising new lesson plans to help increase Eddard&apos;s emotional composure and resistance to Warp-craft. Arik avoided Meghann Winzar, Eddards Matrari rushing into the chamber. Even if Magnus had hurt her son she would not condone what he was about to do.</p><p>Taranis left the Primarch Quarters and headed for his own within the Palace, still with the unconscious Primarch slung over his shoulder. Along the way, he sent various messages to invested parties. A request to Luna and Malcador. Sitreps to the Custodes about what happened and an apologetic message to Lybara Rasut, it would not sate the Witch but maybe keep her from trying to kill him for what he was going to do to her adopted son.</p><p>Ten hours later Magnus Rubricar awoke with a start. His superhuman senses and mind kicked in instantly, allowing him to bypass the confused haze a baseline human would be in his place. Magnus did not recognize where he was, it appeared to be a dimly lit large storage chamber somewhere in the palace. He recognized the architecture and he seemed to be in a clearing between storage containers.</p><p>The next thing Magnus noticed was that he was fully armored. His War-gear had been placed on him and to either side of him were his two favored none warp powered weapons. The Zheng-Staff was modified for real combat and next to it was a Plasma Pistol that Magnus had learned to use in combination with pyrokinesis. The Primarch rose to his feet and realized the building-sized containers had been arranged in an odd shape, that of an arena.</p><p>A deep vicious voice boomed out of the shadows &quot;Pick up your Weapons and prepare for combat!&quot;</p><p>Almost subconsciously Magnus started to before he asked &quot;Uncle Arik? Is that you? What is going on here?&quot;</p><p>On top of the farthest container, Arik Taranis emerged into the dim light. He was dressed in his full battle-plate and wore a grim smile. &quot;Magnus Rubricar you failed the Challenge of flesh and steel when you used your warp-powers to beat Eddard Fendragoon. You must be taught a lesson.&quot;</p><p>Magnus simply scoffed at that &quot;I did nothing wrong, my powers are my weapons and I used them to emerge victorious. Anyway, it was just a stupid training bout.&quot;</p><p>The smile faded from the Old Warriors lips and he continued &quot;You show your ignorance and egotism whelp. The Powers of the Warp are not yours, they have never been and never will. That is the first lesson your Father taught you correct?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes but I use them to make it fair against my bro-&quot; Magnus was interrupted by a glare that could have stopped a charging army.</p><p>&quot;There is no such thing as fair in War boy. Those challenges are meant to keep you and your brothers from relying too heavily on one skill. I watched you fight Eddard and saw how arrogant and self-righteous you were. Magnus you have great potential, you know that but your knowledge of it seems to be spoiling it child.&quot; chided Arik.</p><p>The Ur-Primarch gestured to the weapons still at Magnus&apos;s feet. &quot;You refused to learn these lessons the easy way, and are headed down a dark path you cannot be permitted on. I have taken upon myself to teach you the hard way. Now pick up your damn weapon and prepare for combat.&quot;</p><p>Snarling Magnus started to float up into the air while speaking &quot;Arik you have no right to do this. When Malcador finds out you have kidnapped me! When my Father does! Oh you are in for-AGGGGHHHHH&quot;</p><p>Just as he crested the top of the containers the ruins Arik and Ghota had spent a few hours painting with livestock blood flared to life. The Lighting Bearer was no sorcerer and barely psychic but he had picked many tricks during the Unification Wars. Magnus Plummeted to earth and angrily took up the weapons and started to snarl a curse, either literal or figurative.</p><p>Arik gestured around to countless marking covering seemingly every inch of the room in a pattern. &quot;I would not do that if I were you. This entire chamber has been bound by hundreds of wards, rituals, and ruins over the years. Occansily when I am doing some dirty work for your Father I catch a live one and bring them back here to help keep me sharp. Xeno&apos;s, Witches, and worse have all fought and bled and here. Not one has escaped and trust me kiddo a lot of them were more powerful than you currently are.&quot;</p><p>Magnus&apos;s power waned and he glared sourly up at Arik &quot;So how do you intend to &quot;teach&quot; me to cripple myself? Come down here and pummel me into the ground while your wards keep me weak? Because I will tell you right now that I will just work to become more powerful so something like that can never happen again&quot;</p><p>Dropping his great bulk down, Arik sat on the edge of the container and smacked on its side. &quot;Oh, I know that wouldn&apos;t work. I am not gonna kick your arse. She is gonna kill you&quot;</p><p>A Blade pierced out of the container and carved a door open. Out Stepped a Power-armored woman. Her hair was done up in a topknot and in her hands, she carried a Power-Claymore as large as she was. The wards had obscured her presence and the minute she locked eyes with Magnus his stomach dropped. Two things stood out to the Primarch. First was the sheer spiteful disdain in her ice blue eyes, they bored into him and he felt the utter hate she felt for him.</p><p>The second and much more visceral was realizing what she was. The woman was a Pariah, a Null Soul and an extremely powerful one at that. Magnus had encountered Blanks and Pariahs multiple times throughout his training but none like this. Most were Shadows or voids in the warp. This woman was a Black Hole that gorged itself on the Warp. Reflexively he picked up the weapons and got into battle stance.</p><p>Arik chuckled &quot;Good, you&apos;re learning. This here is Natarasha Krole. The only Super-Pariah on Terra. She is also the sole survivor of a lineage of Witch Hunters that were wiped out by Ursh. Natarasha does not like foolhardy warp-wielders and has been given permission by me to execute you for unsanctioned malefic psykana.&quot;</p><p>Magnus gaped at Arik: &quot;You can&apos;t be serious? I am a son of the Emperor himself. You will be both executed for this treason!&quot;</p><p>The Thunder Warrior responded with a chuckle: &quot;Oh I am deadly serious. Either you win and get your act together or you lose and the Emperor returns to a palace in mourning for you after that tragic accident. So get it together Magnus, are you really not capable of beating a mortal woman?&quot;</p><p>Snarling bitterly Magnus summoned a corona of psychic energy around him. His witch sight peered into the ether and he felt the mass of wards around him press into his power. They appeared to be keeping him within the arena and prevented his escape or destruction of it. He was trapped in this arena. The only way was through the Mortal before him.</p><p>Smirking Magnus summoned Witchfyre into his palms and prepared to blast the Pariah into a paste. Part of his own personal training was learning to overcome the powers of Black-Souled abominations. For a being of his power, it was relatively easy. To deal with the weaker ones he could simply overwhelm their anti-soul, similar to how a flame that is hot enough will boil away water before it can extinguish it. The more powerful ones like the wretch before him required a more&#x2026; subdued touch.</p><p>The Mage focused his own psychic aura into a tight vortex around him, designed to protect it from the Pariahs draining effects. The Witchfyre was modulated to produce the maximum amount of true-fire, the spark and fuel may be psychic but the blaze would be real enough to hurt even this damnable soul-sucker.</p><p>He let the firebolts fly and watched them move at supersonic speed towards the Women. She was moving the moment he let them fly, spinning like some absurd dancer she let the bolts graze right past her. The psychic energy within them was almost instantly devoured by the proximity to the Pariah. Magnus cursed as the twin flames guttered out, robbed of fuel. He could tell she was not strictly baseline human, some low-level gene or chem augments were at work. No mortal could move like that.</p><p>Magnus was right but had only brushed the edge of the full extent of her abilities. Krole had been enhanced for the specific purpose of surviving this first engagement with an enemy psyker. After that, her nature did the rest of the work. Krole charged the Emperor&apos;s son with her Claymore raised. A Feral howl escaped her lips. This misguided experiment by the Master of Mankind would be put down before it was allowed to taint the infant Imperium.</p><p>Natarasha Krole was one of the most powerful Pariahs to ever exist and had been trained in her Clans arts, the techniques she was about to unleash would become the cornerstones of two organizations the Imperium and galaxy at large would grow to fear. These organizations would be born of both Kroles linage and skill set, they were the Sisters of Silence and Clade Culuxus.</p><p>The energy the Emperors princeling had discharged was absorbed into her Null-soul. It was consumed and converted into power for her to wield. Despite being barely augmented past a Peak-Human she charged Magnus at speeds an Astartes would be proud to match. She saw a mix of shock and fear in his eyes. It was a good sight.</p><p>She was slow compared to his brothers but far faster than she had any right to be. Magnus blocked the Claymores strike before leaping into the air. He was outside the blades range and started to chant incantations to empower himself for the duel. The blade could not reach but her gauntlet mounted Flamers could.</p><p>Fire erupted forth obscuring Magnus&apos;s Vision, his Telekine shield wailed in protest but held. It had done little other than startle him and stop his chanting. That was the goal. His transhuman senses heard the unmistakable growl of straining power armor just as Krole Lept into the air, she passed through the rapidly dying fireball as if it was not there. Her claymore came down on Magnus in a parody of what Eddard had tried. Except hers coursed with Pariah-Energy.</p><p>His shield did not buckle or cleave but was drained out of existence into the blade. Magnus had against his mentors and brothers advice forged his armor primarily to enhance his powers. Servo-motors were stripped to not interfere with incantations. Sturdier metals were passed over for ones with ritual significance. Auto-senses and shielding had been replaced with warp-imbued items. The Fifteenth Primarch began to realize the folly of this when the Pariah-Womens blade splintered his collarbone.</p><p>The Primarch screamed and felt his power bleed from him. The pain and Pariah-Aura forced him out of telekinetic flight. He crashed into the Arenas floor, the blade still in him. Krole rode his descent and used the shock of the impact to dislodge the sword. She was not stupid and backed out of his reach. Krole circled him like a hungry lioness.</p><p>Hundreds of spells and enchantments that had once empowered Magnus constantly faded and died. When she had wounded him the proximity had let her Aura drain and ruin years worth of effort. He staggered to his feet and grasped his wounded shoulder. It was healing, but not as fast as it should.</p><p>Arik answered his unspoken question &quot;A Primarch is a being of two realms, your powers draw from both. Guess what happens when you are disconnected from one of them?&quot;</p><p>Magnus snarled and with a mental effort usually reserved for tossing tanks he pulled his staff into his hand from a few feet away. The instant he did she was on him again. She was faster and stronger than before, glutted on Magnus&apos;s spells she now matched any Champion of the Legions. Yet Magnus was a Primarch who&apos;s usual sparring partners were his brothers.</p><p>Slowly he started to match her rhythm. Steadily his defensive movements became more and more aggressive. Arik watched and started to smile, the brat might be learning after all. Sparks flew from their blades and arcs of energy cascaded off the power-fields. With a burst of superhuman muscle, Magnus pushed Krole back and took his opportunity.</p><p>Taranis swore as he realized what Magnus was doing. Instead of pressing his advantage he had fallen back and was mustering his gifts. The Primarch called out &quot;I will not be limited! This duel is pointless and I will prove to you both the superiority of my craft!&quot; Arik swore again when he realized the sheer amount of Energy Magnus was mustering. A Blank could be defeated by overloading their distorted connection to the Warp. The brat assumed it was the same with Pariahs, just scaled up. It was anything but.</p><p>A Beam of screaming-souls was let loose from the Primarchs hands, the Energy released could have turned a Small Titan into a haunted-puddle of molten metal. Natarasha Krole faced it head-on. She absorbed all she could and deflected and dispersed what she couldn&apos;t. She could feel her armor start to melt and morph around her as the impossible energy sought to devour her whole. Clenching her jaw hard enough to crack teeth she stood firm and focused. No witch no matter how powerful could stand against her. The Last of the Mute-Crow Clan was the product of generations of experimentation and eugenics. She would survive this and start her family anew.</p><p>Arik scrambled to activate a dozen wards, each not capable of stopping a Greater Neverborn but sure as hades inconvenience them as he had learned from experience. They seemed to barely affect the geyser of power erupting from the Primarch. It seemed barely weaker but steadily becoming more diffuse, like a stream of water being split by an object in its path. Arik realized the metaphor was more apt than he thought.</p><p>Krole was pushing into the beam and almost reached the Primarch. His eyes widened in shock as she finally reached the Primarch. He did not see the blow but knew it must have connected when the energy stopped. The utterly spent Primarch stumbled back, a large gash on his chest starting to ooze blood. His eyes suddenly unfocused and the Fifteenth son collapsed. Arik rushed over and found what was left of Krole. Every visible inch of skin was burnt, her blade was a smoking piece of slag and the hand that had pressed into the beam was a skeletal stump.</p><p>Cursing more thoroughly now Arik wondered how many pieces he would end up in if he had really just killed a Primarch and one of Malcadors proteges. He glanced over at the Primarch and we relieved to see the wound was shallow enough for his augmented blood to clot over.</p><p>Krole was a different story, she was still technically alive but looked like she had just fallen from orbit. Her charred mouth sputtered open and she inhaled a raspy breath. As she inhaled burned flesh started to slough off and muscles regrew. Arik had seen many things but the sight of this woman being knit back together was one of the stranger ones. It was not a perpetual rebirth or that of a tumor-beast, this was like the injuries were being undone.</p><p>After a minute or so a naked and twitching Krole lay before him. Her left arm still bore burn-scars of where she had blocked the beam, and Arik correctly suspected those would never heal. She then sat up and let out a scream that lasted far longer than it had any right to. It finally ended and she started to shakily get to her feet.</p><p>Shivering from exhaustion she spoke: &quot;That...that was beyond the possible. I can regenerate injuries by feeding off warp-power but that&#x2026; I was being destroyed as fast as I was rebuilt.&quot;</p><p>Krole stumbled and Arik caught her. The stunned women vomited onto the floor and then asked: &quot;What now?&quot;</p><p>Smiling grimly Arik helped her walk as they exited the Arena &quot;I get some better wards and we keep trying to knock sense into the brat.&quot;</p><p>Krole snarled at that: &quot;Would be better to let me kill him and be done with it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Doubtful, if my hypothesis is correct that tyke is far more important to the Emperor than we could ever imagine&quot;</p><p>Arik patched the unconscious Primarch and shocked Pariah up and prepared to try again the next day. It ended less disastrously but still with Magnus getting cocky and relying on his powers. This processes repeated itself for nearly a month. Each day the Primarch would awake, eat, and then get pummeled by the Pariah. Each day though he seemed to rely less on his Psychic nature. Yet still, the lesson was not fully getting through.</p><p>Eventually, Arik started bringing in other Witch Hunters, these mortals had a much rougher go of it but most still managed to challenge Magnus. Arik found himself honestly disappointed many times. These were clever mortals with a few augments here and there. Literally beneath a Primarchs notice but Magnus was struggling.</p><p>It eventually came to a head three months into the experiment. When after the 75th time Krole had beaten him the Primarch let out a dejected howl and slumped to his knees. Finally, his hubris was broken. Putting his hands up in defeat the Primarch spat out the words &quot;I give up. You have beaten it into me. My powers may be great but are fallible&quot;</p><p>Arik grinned, the Mage had been humbled at last. It was the oldest trick in the Drill Instructor book, break a recruit down utterly and build him up better than he ever could be before. For a Primarch it had taken an absurd amount of effort, a cargo-hauler of supplies to bribe the Lunar Pariah Program, and a large number of powerful Psychic defenses to protect him from Magnus&apos;s Matrai. Yet it had been done. Now all that remained was rebuilding him into what he was meant to be.</p>
