    Primarch: XI Kalib Kraad<br>
    <br>
    Foster World: The Labyrinth- Space Hulk that suffered extreme Warp contamination. Raised ferally with no humans or
    sentients on Hulk. Fought constantly against Daemonic incursions and lived off of mutated vermin. <br>
    <br>
    Discovery: 18th Psychic signature detected by us and we lead a company of his legion in purging the Hulk and
    discovering the feral mutated Primarch. Killed a dozen of his own legion before being subdued. <br>
    <br>
    Capabilities: Displayed virtual immunity to Chaos and possessed a psychotic instinctive hatred of Warpspawn and a
    master of eliminating them. Heavily mutated, with physical capabilities greater than most of his siblings. Mute do
    to Daemonic venom affecting his vocal cords. <br>
    <br>
    Legion: Silent Brotherhood- a Brutal close-range combatant who inspire an extreme amount of Transhuman Dread in any
    humans they encounter. Mutated Omophagea that caused a craving for human flesh and blood, and empowers Legionaries
    who feed often and plentifully. Intensity of mutation only increased with Primarch sourced Geneseed.<br>
    <br>
    Heresy: Traitor- Purged long before the Heresy when it was discovered the Legion had been cannibalizing entire human
    worlds populations. Attempted an unknown sorcerous ritual as the VI closed in as an attempt to escape judgment.
    Primarch disappeared into the warp due to Ritual and 95% of the Legion was purged by the VI Legion. <br>
    <br>
    Fate: Believed to have achieved Pseudo-Daemonhood as a minor Warp deity. Currently a minor player in the Great Game
    that seeks to destroy both the Imperium and Chaos. Survivors of the Legion reappeared after the Great Scouring,
    tricked Imperium and became a now renegade Astartes Chapter.<br>
    <br>
    Conclusion: Extreme Failure- Corrupted and mutated by Warp influence from birth. Displayed extreme psychological
    instability and a mix of both natural and warpborn insanity. His legions mutations caused the deaths of billions and
    even after returning to the Imperial Fold they betrayed us and worship there fallen Primarch.
