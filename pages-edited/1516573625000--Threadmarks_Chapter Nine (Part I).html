            Chapter Nine: The First Temple<br>
            <br>
            Uriah Olathaire was old, not just physically but mentally and spiritually. he could feel the weight of the
            years in his bones and upon his soul. Ironically he had not lived as many years as some and was just
            entering the second half of his life. Yet the years he had spent alive were especially harsh ones. Wars had
            been fought, families lost, homes burned and ways of life driving to extinction.<br>
            <br>
            These thoughts occupied the Last Priest of the Church of the Lighting Stone as he extinguished candles and
            cleaned the old place of worship. Uriah had joined the creed as a young man and had watched as his
            congregation had shrunk with each passing year. The Emperor&apos;s &#x201C;truth&#x201D; saw to that.
            Religion had been declared the enemy, a source of woes and misery. Every Month new reports came in of great
            Cathedrals and Temples being looted, converted and torn down.<br>
            <br>
            Horror stories of clerics and Cardinals being dragged away into the night persisted, with many religious
            sights becoming abandoned due to their clergy fleeing the Emperor&apos;s minions. Some of Uriah&#x2019;s
            more devout partitioners had asked and even begged to help him flee the purges. He had turned each and every
            one of them down. Telling each that &#x201C;I have lived for this church and if need be I will die for this
            church&#x201D;<br>
            <br>
            Eventually even those most devout had stopped coming, the past few weeks Uriah had been alone in the ancient
            building. With nothing but the crashing of the waves and ancient scripture for company. Letting out a deep
            sigh the Old Priest went to lock the great oaken doors of the building. As he approached them a knock
            sounded.<br>
            <br>
            Uriah opened the door, wondering who could have come calling at this late hour. The doors swing open and a
            man stood before Uriah. Clothed in the uniform of an Imperial Officer the raven-haired man struck an
            imposing figure. The Officer looked into Uriah&#x2019;s eyes and the Priest had the unpleasant sensation
            that he was being studied like a scientific specimen being prepared for dissection. A subconscious shiver
            ran up Uriah&#x2019;s spine at the thought.<br>
            <br>
            The strange man reached out his hand to shake Uriah&#x2019;s and spoke: &#x201C;You are Father Uriah
            Olathaire: Priest of the Lighting Stone Church correct?&#x201D; Refocusing and shaking off the momentary
            anxiety Uriah took the strangers hand and replied:&#x201C;Yes, and you are?&#x201D; The Stranger said,
            &#x201C;You can simply call me Revelation.&#x201D; Uriah scoffed at that &#x201C;How ominous, what can this
            old priest help you with Revelation?&#x201D;<br>
            <br>
            A momentary pained expression crossed the Strangers face before he continued &#x201C;I seek your
            counsel.&#x201D; Revelations inflection stunk of disdain, and he was obviously disgusted with the idea.
            Uriah had seen pride and ego of countless varieties throughout his tenure and he could easily recognize the
            signs of a man who detested asking for help. A kind smile appeared on the priests face and he spoke
            &#x201C;Of course my son. Come in, come in!.&#x201D;<br>
            <br>
            Uriah led the man toward the pews and noticed the Stranger examining the various frescoes and paintings that
            adorned the Church. Uriah smiled, the art of the church had long been something he had enjoyed and loved
            sharing with worshippers. Revelation pointed at a trinity of paintings that took up one of the walls
            &#x201C;Isandula Verona&#x2019;s work? I have not seen some of hers in many years&#x201D;<br>
            <br>
            Uriah&#x2019;s face brightened &#x201C;It&apos;s been decades since someone recognized her work. One of my
            predecessors was gifted that piece after she attended one of his sermons&#x201D; The three paintings showed
            iconic scenes from the Church&apos;s creed. The first depicted nude figures within a utopian garden. The
            Second an epic duel between a Golden Knight and a Silver Dragon, and the last showed a being made of light
            surrounded by a mechanical halo.<br>
            <br>
            The Stranger continued to stare for a minute before he turned to the priest and spoke: &#x201C;Do you know
            what has been the fate of the grand churches and temples of Terra?&#x201D; Uriah eyed Revelations uniform
            and begin to wonder if this visit was more sinister in nature than he originally thought.<br>
            <br>
            The Old Priest sighed and spoke &#x201C;Yes, they have been destroyed by the Emperor and his legions. Is
            that why you have come? To destroy my Church like all the others have been?&#x201D; At that Revelations eyes
            seemed to lose all emotion as he spoke: &#x201C;Yes, but your council is required as well.&#x201D;<br>
            <br>
            Revelation walked up to the altar and continued speaking &#x201C;Do you know how many Churches exist on
            Terra? How many Priests are left?&#x201D; Barely processing the news of his impending eviction and possible
            execution Uriah spoke &#x201C;A few hundred? A few thousand? Your Master has been through in his mission
            from what I hear.&#x201D; At that, a snort of derision escaped Revelation &#x201C;Only one of each
            remain.&#x201D; He gestured to Uriah and the building they were in &#x201C;The Last Church and the Last
            Priest of Terra&#x201D;<br>
            <br>
            Uriah felt like a hammer blow had come down on his forehead. Could he truly be the Last Priest? Could all
            traces of faith be scoured from Humanity&apos;s Cradle this easily? A mixture of grief and anger filled
            Uriah&#x2019;s heart. In a bitter voice, he spat &#x201C;So what council could you possibly seek from me?
            You serve the regime that has more successfully extinguished the light of faith and salvation. What in the
            name Yeshua Crossed could you want from me?&#x201D;<br>
            <br>
            Bitterness filled Revelations face as he spoke &#x201C;I want to know if I was wrong? I concluded that
            religion is a toxic dangerous thing a long time ago and time and again that conclusion has been reinforced
            by countless acts of insanity and zealotry I have witnessed.&#x201D; Rage filled Revelations face as he
            finished.<br>
            <br>
            Letting out a defeated sigh he continued &#x201C;Yet despite that, new evidence has come to light. Evidence
            that no matter what is done humanity will seek something or someone to worship and that faith can be used.
            Used to protect against the darkness.&#x201D;<br>
            <br>
            Uriah had met many atheists, agnostics, and naysayers throughout his career. There reasoning and believes
            varied and it was not atypical for him to encounter those attempting to refute his faith or rekindle their
            own. Revelation seemed to be both but not quite. He spoke more like a scientist questioning results than a
            tortured soul seeking solace in their own convictions or faith.<br>
            <br>
            Uriah slowly approached Revelation and spoke, &#x201C;Tell me, my son, what has caused this change in your
            beliefs?&#x201D; The Old Priest was not just doing his duty as a man of the cloth but genuine curiosity. The
            stranger who had entered his Church was obviously a high ranking member of the Imperium. Someone who should
            sneer at the idea of religion and laugh at the idea that it was more than a narcotic for the masses. Yet
            shadows of doubt encircled Revelation and a curious thought occurred to Uriah.<br>
            <br>
            This stranger spoke with such authority and without fear. Someone of his position should be terrified of
            being discovered anywhere near a place of worship not being sacked, let alone asking a Priest for advice.
            Obviously, Revelation was a person of great power and authority. Could his arrival be a sign from the
            Heavens that maybe the flames of faith were not yet doomed to be extinguished? <br>
            <br>
            Revelation spoke to Uriah in a hushed whisper: &#x201C;I saw something, a vision.&#x201D; At this Uriah
            raised an eyebrow, such things were the domain of prophets and seers. Many of whom had been put to death by
            the Imperium. &#x201C;What did you see my child?&#x201D; &#x201C;I saw a future where the Emperor is
            worshipped as a god, where everything he stands for is perverted into a colossal theocratic nightmare where
            trillions of screaming fanatics live and die underneath the rule of the Immortal God Emperor of
            Mankind.&#x201D;<br>
            <br>
            The words seemed to physically pain Revelation to speak but he continued. &#x201C;But the worst of it, the
            worst aspect of that nightmarish future where hope, reason, and logic were butchered in the name of dogma,
            zealotry, and oppression was that it worked. Humanity was truly united under the &#x201C;Imperial
            Creed.&#x201D; Faith protected against horrors beyond imagination, it fueled heroic acts and empowered the
            loyalist of mankind.&#x201D;<br>
            <br>
            Revelation seemed to sag underneath some invisible burden and he slumped onto the front pew. The ancient
            wood groaned as if a dozen men had sat down instead of one. Uriah sat next to his guest and said softly
            &#x201C;I am no prophet nor psyker but I could predict such a vision perfectly.&#x201D;<br>
            <br>
            The Priest gestured around them as he spoke &#x201C;Humanity has sought to believe in a higher power for as
            long as we have existed. Believe offers both protection and answers to countless questions. It grants solace
            and if that solace is denied the yearning for it becomes simply greater.&#x201D;<br>
            <br>
            At that Revelation snapped &#x201C;Yet I have given them exactly that. Protection from every evil and
            abomination to stalk the shadows. The Arts and Sciences are slowly returning to there former greatness to
            answer questions of both material and immaterial nature.&#x201D; A mixture of fury and questioning worry
            filled Revelations eyes.<br>
            <br>
            Uriah confused by the strange wording of Revelations outburst looked into his eyes, and was shocked at what
            he saw. Revelation looked no older than Forty standard years but his eyes were those of an ancient. Filled
            with centuries if not millennia of pain and knowledge.<br>
            <br>
            Realization and shock filled the Old Priest as the truth dawned on him. The realization of his guest&apos;s
            identity. The Emperor of Mankind had come to seek his counsel. Rumors had abounded for years about the age
            and nature of the mysterious conqueror of Terra. The man who was equal parts Tyrannical overlord and
            Benevolent Leader.<br>
            <br>
            Taking a deep breath Uriah gathered himself and continued &#x201C;Even if you offer alternatives to what
            religion offers and show the world all that is negative about it people will still desire it. Religion and
            Faith are as old as humanity, even during the heights of the Golden Age it still existed when nearly every
            evil and darkness in our species had been eradicated. It is not an evil thing, but just as corruptible as so
            much else of being human. Humanity needs to believe in a higher power and denying that will only lead to
            ruin.&#x201D;<br>
            <br>
            The Emperor-in-disguise looked at Uriah and sadness filled his voice: &#x201C;You know who I am, I saw it
            within your mind when you realized the truth. No need to hide it, Uriah.&#x201D; Shutting his ancient eyes
            the Emperor continued &#x201C;You are wrong about one thing for certain, religion is not as old as humanity.
            I have lived for close to Fifty Thousand Years and I remember when the first cults and tribal religions
            rose.&#x201D;<br>
            <br>
            Slowly standing the Emperor walked up to the altar and stood at it like an expectant worshiper &#x201C;And
            the idea that religion is a constant is also wrong. I am responsible for its creation and it&apos;s only
            fitting I am responsible for its destruction.
