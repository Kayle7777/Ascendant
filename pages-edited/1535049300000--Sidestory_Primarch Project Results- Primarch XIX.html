    Primarch: XIX Corvus Corax<br />
    <br />
    Foster World: Deliverance/Lycaeus- Mineral Rich Moon of Forge world Kiavahr. Populated by mining slaves who adopted
    XIX upon his arrival. Raised him to be their revolutionary Leader and liberator. Succeeded in this endeavor and
    broke the Tech-Clan enslavers.<br />
    <br />
    Discovery: 19th- Our expedition fleet arrived in the Kiavahr system almost immediately after the end of XIX&#x2019;s
    revolution. Meeting went well with XIX seeing our physical body. Unification with legion occurred sub-par. XIX
    rebuilt his legion from the ground up to better favor his tactical skills and to purge undesirable elements.<br />
    <br />
    Capabilities: Intelligent and observant XIX personified the skill set and personality types adept at stealth and
    shadow operations. Inherited our psychic ability to erase our presence, which was passed along his Gene-line to a
    certain extent. Extremely introspective and excellent at observing the true nature of things.<br />
    <br />
    Legion: Raven Guard: Like their gene-source the XIXth Legion operated with efficiency, stealth, and precision. While
    never a particularly large Legion the Raven Guard was extremely effective at destroying non-compliant governments
    and liberating enslaved humans. Noted to generally, have atypical moral centers due to the more flexible Astartes
    being exiled to a number of unsanctioned successors.<br />
    <br />
    Heresy: Loyal: Suffered horrifically at the Drop Site Massacre, the vast majority of the XIX Legion was wiped out
    and XIX himself was gravely wounded. Fears related to the true nature of the Primarchs caused a psychological crisis
    that was further exacerbated by a failed rebuilding of his legion using our knowledge. Spent the latter years of the
    Heresy running guerrilla campaigns against Traitor supply lines with his mutant Astartes acting as
    shock-troopers.<br />
    <br />
    Fate: Post-heresy he supported XIII&#x2019;s reforms and returned to his homeworld to euthanize the mutant Raven
    Guard Astartes. This finally caused XIX&#x2019;s psychological breakdown. Fled into the Warp in an attempt to redeem
    himself. Unlocked his full warp-born potential and exists as an icon of fear for the Traitors to this day. This
    Crow-King warp-monster and the myths of VIII are the inspiration for the Raptor-God minor warp-deity.<br />
    <br />
    Conclusion: Semi-Successful: Competent in his skill set and willing to do what was necessary to protect the
    Imperium. XIX&#x2019;s strong moral compass allowed him to be an effective leader and liberator of humanity, it also
    spelled his downfall. While he possessed the skills and nature to make difficult decisions his morality made living
    with the necessary evil far too straining on his psyche.
