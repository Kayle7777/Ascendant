                Chapter Twenty One: Gold, Silver, and Steel</b><br>
            <br>
            <i>Location: The Heart of the Inner Sanctum, Luna<br>
                <br>
                Date: 814.M30 (214 Terran Minutes since the duel started)</i><br>
            <br>
            <br>
            The Emperor&#x2019;s message rattled through Kalib and Marcus&#x2019;s minds. &#x201C;Recover your brother,
            his Legion, the Spear and evacuate immediately. An experimental weapon is to be unleashed&#x201D;<br>
            <br>
            Momentary doubt flickered through the superhuman minds of the Primarchs. Their Father had seemingly sent
            Horus to his death! That doubt was quickly washed away by the content of the message, for the Emperor had a
            plan. The Master of Mankind was always ahead of his enemies, even if they were the Dark Gods. The message
            had shaken both Be&#x2019;lakor and the Primarchs. Resetting the flow of battle.<br>
            <br>
            The pause did not last long. A vicious roar escaped Be&#x2019;lakor as he charged the Primarchs once again.
            The two young demigods struggled to parry the blows, not because of any failure in their training or in
            their spirit, they were just simply outclassed by the First Prince of Chaos. Even with the knowledge that
            they could not win this fight, they continued the struggle, telepathically relaying orders and information
            to their legions all the while. The still living elite of the XVI were ferried out of the chamber and
            towards evac points. The dead were harvested and marked with runes of warding. A troop of pallbearers from
            both XI and XIII Legions attempted to move Horus Lupercali, but crackling psionic residue coating the fallen
            Primarch and his considerable bulk hampered this effort.<br>
            <br>
            As duel continued, a series of emergency Vox transmission crackled into the Primarchs&#x2019; armor. The
            Legion Fleets spotted something moving at incredible speeds headed for the Lunar North Pole. Auspex readings
            were off the charts, and any psychic probes they sent towards the object had produced bizarre results.
            Whatever weapon the Emperor had unleashed was coming in fast. To the fleet, it appeared like a flaming
            meteor, somehow defying the laws of physics by lighting a trail of psychic destruction across the hard
            vacuum of Luna&#x2019;s surface. Despite lacking any conventional or detectable thrust system, the object
            which was smaller than a drop-pod was moving at velocities an Imperial Destroyer would be pressed to
            match.<br>
            <br>
            A crew member onboard an XIII Legion escort craft watched its path as she manned one of the ships Flak
            turrets. By sheer luck, she was closest to the fireball and had an impressive view of the object. The gunner
            would swear for the rest of her days that whatever she saw, it had wings.<br>
            <br>
            The comet suddenly changed direction, diving straight towards the lunar surface. Frantic orders from Terra
            prevented it from being fired upon, with the Imperial Fleet watching apprehensively as it struck moon.
            Instead of a massive cloud of ash erupting from a tremendous impact, it seemed to pierce right through the
            Lunar bedrock. An arrow of light and fire set loose from the Emperor&#x2019;s vaults.<br>
            <br>
            The impact could still be felt from within the Inner Sanctum. A high pitched hum seemed to resonate through
            the entire Moon as it bore through the satellite. The Primarchs attempted to disengage from the duel but
            were stopped by the fury of their opponent&#x2019;s blades. Any weakness or misstep would lead to
            catastrophic injury. The noise only increased and the temperature within the Chamber started to climb.
            Orders were given, the Astartes evacuated, leaving the body of Horus. It would be up to the fallen
            Primarch&#x2019;s siblings to remove him. Marcus silently hoped that they could survive whatever was coming.
            A quick glance at his brother told him that they were both beginning to have serious doubts about this
            conflict. The belief of invincibility and immortality that naturally came with youth and supernatural power
            was rapidly fading from both of the Primarchs.<br>
            <br>
            Then finally, after what seemed like an seeming eternity, judgment came. Like a boring drill made of solid
            flame, the Angel burned through the bedrock and smashed through the ceiling, exploding into the chamber in a
            corona of psychic fire. It had burned a straight hole to the Sanctum. Scorching away stone, steal and the
            Dark Gods touch. The corrupted stone and steel composing the inner Sanctum recoiled from it, the
            Angel&#x2019;s fire searing away at the Warp&#x2019;s influence. It was a pure and terrible shard of the
            Anathema, the thing that Chaos feared above all else.<br>
            <br>
            All three combatants stopped the duel as it crashed through the ceiling. Impotent rage and a twinge of fear
            radiated from Be&#x2019;lakor while the Primarchs were more shocked than anything. Before them stood a woman
            made of fire. It radiated an aura of order, domination, and destruction they had only felt one other place.
            This illuminating shadow of their father was a lesser and far more terrible thing of the Emperor. It was all
            the fire and fury of Mankind&apos;s protector, stripped of its compassion and humanity. Yet on some hidden
            buried level, the two Primarchs felt something disturbingly similar. A spark of power and majesty only felt
            when in the presence of kin. This weapon&#x2026; It was a Primarch but not a Primarch.<br>
            <br>
            The Angel looked upon the Primarchs and spoke in a voice of legions. &#x201C;Take the XVI and leave. My
            flames shall purge the unclean.&#x201D;<br>
            <br>
            Without another word, it turned to Be&#x2019;lakor. A blade of blue-flames materialized within its hand. The
            Daemon Prince smiled a wicked grin and prepared to face its first true challenge in eons. Before him was the
            Anathema&#x2019;s scion, it would die by his claw! Frantically Kalib and Marcus rushed over to Horus and
            hoisted his body up, his noble arms draped over each of their shoulders. Ignoring the sparking pain of
            psychic shock and the burning heat of the Angel, the brothers bolted from the Chamber. This was not a battle
            for them, they were like ancient myth-heroes stuck between clashing titans. Heraecles Half-God and Percyus
            Argos-Maker were mighty figures, but nothing compared to the wrath of Tarturaiz or Ourano. Such was the
            difference between young Primarchs and ancient Daemon Kings. One day that would not be the case, but for now
            they would have to take comfort in the knowledge that survival was their key objective.<br>
            <br>
            As the three Primarchs left the chamber, the Angel and Be&#x2019;lakor faced each other, black and gold
            flames crackling around them as the fabric of the room buckled under the weight of the psychic power present
            in the chamber. Both combatants watched for weakness, slowly circling the sanctum like dueling apex
            predators. At some unknown signal, the Angel and Daemon charged. Like colliding planetoids, they locked
            blades, unleashing a shockwave of psychokinetic force that detonated with a thunderous boom which shook the
            inner sanctum and cracked its stone structure.<br>
            <br>
            In the cathedral-sized sanctum, they clashed. To mortal eyes, it would appear like twin stars colliding. One
            of inhuman heat and power, the other of oily daemonic chill. Be&#x2019;lakor was capable of wielding more
            power in the materium in eons. The First Prince was a mass of sheer evil, a thing of doom and damnation. The
            Angel was worse. It was a thing of undiluted domination. Raw power barely directed by the Emperor&apos;s
            will. Be&#x2019;lakor spat curses and profane insults with every strike. Grim silence was the Angel&#x2019;s
            only answer.<br>
            <br>
            Just as their physical bodies dueled, the monsters fought spiritually. Chaotic and Anathemic energies were
            unleashed. Distorting and destroying the sanctum in a never-ending cycle. Flying through the rapidly
            crumbling sanctum, the Angel hacked away at Be&#x2019;lakor&#x2019;s guard. Each blow a thing of blessed
            steel, holy flames, and divine fury. The Daemon Prince was puzzled by what he fought. Its existence was an
            unknown, some terrible tool the Anathema had kept locked away. Be&#x2019;lakor could feel that this
            &#x201C;Angel&#x201D; had more in common with him than any human. It was a blasphemy to everything the
            so-called Emperor believed in. Something that should have been hidden away in shame. For it to be unleashed
            was truly interesting.<br>
            <br>
            With serpentine whispers, the Daemon plied these questions, hungering for forbidden answers and an advantage
            in the duel. Be&#x2019;lakor had thought himself invincible, for the amount of worship and warp-stuff
            pouring through him had made it to where not even a Primarch could stand against him. The Angel seemed
            intent on proving him wrong. It moved at speeds he barely registered and its swordsmanship was flawless. Its
            power matched Be&apos;lakor in every way, empowered by some unknown source it grew hotter and hotter to
            counter act the rising tide of evil known as Be&apos;lakor. With the souls of the Creed glutting him and the
            power of the rift the Daemon Prince only grew in might.<br>
            <br>
            Like a dynamo of psychic energy, the Angel only grew stronger, its flames expanding, filling the sanctum.
            Scouring away the warp-taint and melting the steel and stone into metal-veined obsidian. It was like
            fighting a Star, a force of nature. The Angel was practically divorced from human characteristics. Order,
            pure and dominating order, given flesh. The Angel&#x2019;s body was not immune to its power. Being burned to
            ash and rebuilt to perfection simultaneously. <br>
            <br>
            Normally, defeat in the material world meant banishment and castigation, annoyances but only setbacks. For
            an ancient and impossibly powerful Daemon Prince like Be&#x2019;lakor, true death was a near impossibility.
            As the Angel-Fire seared his soul, he started to worry if this Anathema-Shard could render him into
            unbeing.<br>
            <br>
            Growling in fury, Be&#x2019;lakor channeled all its might into breaking this foe. His power bloomed like a
            black-hole, growing to devour a world. The entirety of Luna shook with each blow. Thousands of gigatons of
            imaginary energy distorted space/time and ripped continent-length fissures through the Moon. Twin gods, one
            of unbending order, and another of eternal chaos dueled and the universe trembled.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <i>Location: Near Luna&#x2019;s core.<br>
                <br>
                Date: 815.M30 (41 Minutes since the Angel&#x2019;s arrival)</i><br>
            <br>
            <br>
            After escaping the chamber, the Primarchs desperately sent orders for a mass evacuation across the vox
            channels on Luna. The pacification of the Moon was dying down, and only a few heavily entrenched holdout of
            Cultists remained. These traitors cheered the Dark Gods as they saw the Astartes and Auxilia retreat, not
            knowing the source of this temporary salvation came from their gods&#x2019; antithesis. Loyalist forces and
            civilians were herded into massive landing craft. A thunderous migration of millions surged towards the
            Lunar surface, hoping to reach the Astartes evacuation points. With void control, the entire landing power
            of three legions could be put to use.<br>
            <br>
            Marcus and Kalib hauled their brother&#x2019;s body through the winding catacombs within Luna. Both
            superhumans using telepathic and vox communication to coordinate the diaspora towards the Lunar surface.
            Every few seconds, another detonation from the core would echo through the satellite, buffeting the
            Primarchs and sending some of their guards stumbling. The Emperor had unleashed something incredibly
            powerful, and Kalib silently hoped this thing could be locked away again once everything was over. <br>
            <br>
            Relays from the rest of the System were looking excellent however. The enemy fleets had been largely
            composed of demonically infested hulk-ships, millions of years of burned out cosmic refuse ejected from the
            Warp by petulant gods. Compared to the full Imperial might commanded by the Primarchs, it was insignificant.
            The element of surprise and their numbers had been the only advantages possessed. New heroes were baptized
            in void combat and the start of a thousand legends across the twenty legions started.<br>
            <br>
            The huddled masses of the Solar System had watched the forces of evil come. They had heard the maddened
            broadcasts howling for death and damnation. Humanity&#x2019;s cradle had shuddered with fear and revulsion
            as the horrors of Old Night came calling. Those terrified, huddled masses had expected the terrible scene of
            chaotic and xeno marauders violating entire worlds to come once again. Instead, legions of light marched
            forth to meet this great enemy. Millions of champions reborn through human mastery of the cosmos had stood
            between them and the darkness. The Emperor had dueled a false-god and broke it upon the anvil of War. His
            sons had rallied the mightiest armed force in Sol since the near-forgotten days of the Iron War. The Light
            of Salvation had come. Suddenly as if a switch was flipped, a new understanding blossomed in the infant
            Imperium. The Age of Strife was over, the human soul would not be extinguished. No, it would instead burn
            bright with the light of the Emperor. He was not just the Master of Mankind, but the Herald of its
            Salvation. The same fervor that pumped through him and his sons filled them as well. The time to run and
            hide was over. Now it was time to stand and fight.<br>
            <br>
            To the Primarchs within Luna, such grand sentiments escaped them. Grief filled their hearts, and a desperate
            drive to survive propelled them. The fate of Horus had been hidden from the greater part of the legions so
            far. Such a crippling blow to morale could not be allowed at such a crucial time. As they fled the
            calamitous battle raging within Luna, the psionic fire could still be felt. A faint heat that could be
            detected by all within range. No matter when they were, the sensation of a distant inferno could be felt
            coming from the core. Psychic feedback rippling through the Imaterium picked up by countless souls.<br>
            <br>
            Marcus and Kalib could only flee and hope to follow the Emperor&#x2019;s orders. The Primarchs, the body of
            Horus, and their respective honor guards made a strange sight marching through the tunnels. Unknown to them,
            a hidden agent of Chaos had joined this odd caravan. Hiding in the meniscus between the Materium and
            Immaterium was Korban the Eversacrifice. Hidden from the distracted sixth sight of the Primarchs, the
            Daemonhost had stalked them since they exited the inner sanctum, searching for a moment of weakness to
            strike.<br>
            <br>
            It came when a truly cataclysmic impact shook the moon. Crevices large enough to swallow a man erupted
            throughout the tunnel which caused the Primarchs to completely stop in their tracks. The quake combined with
            an eruption of psychic energy buffeted them. At that moment, with all their senses distracted, the
            Eversacrifice struck. Like some nocturnal fiend, Korban materialized from the shadows. In one taloned hand
            was an obsidian blade of sacrifice and in the other a bloody goblet.<br>
            <br>
            Supercharged by the blessings of Chaos and striking at a moment of distracted weakness. Korban ripped the
            cursed dagger across the chests of both Marcus and Horus. The empowered volcanic glass ripped through the
            auramite armor and raked the Primarchs&#x2019; flesh. Exhausted from dueling Be&#x2019;lkaor, Marcus lacked
            the focus to erect a kine-shield or some similar defense fast enough. A splatter of demigod ichor leaped
            through the air. Propelled by the blade&apos;s edge, like paint dripping from a brush. A few drops from two
            possible Arch-Traitors were stolen into the goblet.<br>
            <br>
            With both artifacts anointed in the Primarchs blood Korban attempted to flee. In a single fluid motion, he
            collected the blood, and slashed the dagger across space/time, ripping open a gaping wound into the Warp.
            Chanting black-prayers to the Dark Gods, Korban leaped through the rift in reality, hoping to escape with
            this newly born Athame-Dagger. Despite all his gifts, Korban was only a mutated and damned Astartes, not a
            being capable of harming a Primarch without paying a bloody price.<br>
            <br>
            An edge of blessed Adamant-Silver cleaved through Korban. Kalib Kraad, the XI Primarch had brought his
            war-axe down on the Eversacrifice&#x2019;s midriff, ripping through tainted ceramite, muscle and bone. With
            a blow that held the precision of a surgeon&apos;s scalpel and the might of an artillery barrage, Korban was
            broke in half. Vomiting blood and ichor, the Eversacrifice howled in agony as he fell through the portal.
            His lower half was separated from him and his internal organs were burning in a caustic reaction from the
            thrice-blessed silver. Crippled and in intense pain, Korban the Eversacrifice tumbled into the Warp, still
            clutching the artifacts.<br>
            <br>
            With a shudder, the rift shut behind the fleeing Daemonhost, damning him to tumble through the hell-currents
            of the Warp in a crippled state until the fickle whims of the Dark Gods found it appropriate to release him
            back into the matterium.<br>
            <br>
            The wounds he had inflicted were neither deep nor cursed. Just powerful enough to shed a Primarchs blood.
            Loathe to guess at the reason or nature of this bizarre occurrence, the Primarchs continued their mission
            onwards. They would get their answers eventually, but the threat was dealt with for the time being. Marcus
            Augistio waved his shocked guards away and continued onwards. Escaping the calamity at Luna&#x2019;s core
            took all precedent.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <i>Location: A cavern of molten steel and rock that had once been the Inner Sanctum of the Creed.<br>
                <br>
                Date: 815.M30 (191 Minutes since the Angel&#x2019;s arrival)</i><br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Battling a Daemon is never an easy thing. The Neverborn are not things of meat or metal. One cannot simply
            destroy an integral system and watch its body fail. A Daemon is a mass of sentient (or semi-sentient) Warp
            energy, puppeteering material matter. To banish it back to its hell-dimension home, it must be forced from
            the matter it is controlling. Either by utterly destroying the host, or sapping its energy through wards,
            exorcism and similar rites. The tools used to banish Daemons often use a mix of these factors. The Warhammer
            itself destroys the tissue and circuits, while the symbolism of the Hammer of Witches drives out the
            corrupting Warp-Energy. So when a Daemon is damaged, it is not being truly hurt. Only cast back into the
            pit.<br>
            <br>
            Within the warp where banishment is not possible, battles play out differently. Instead of destroying an
            enemy-Daemon, a part or even all of it will be consumed. Cannibalism and predation between and within each
            God&#x2019;s sphere of influence are very common. Daemons wax, wane and change sides with the shifting
            battle lines of the Warp. Such is the Great Game, where flux is eternal and possibilities are infinite, and
            certainty such as death is alien. True and permanent death is a rare thing indeed. Killing a Daemon requires
            wiping to from the warp itself in such a way that its energy does not rejoin the Great Game but simply
            ceases to be.<br>
            <br>
            The most primitive way to do this is for a far more powerful or uniquely antagonistic Warp-Power to utterly
            reduce the Daemon from being. Much like how a Star can burn entire worlds into nothing buts its most basic
            component atoms. A stark contrast to the cannibalistic exchange common between Daemons. The only power in
            the Immaterium with the will and means to do this is the Anathema. Atham the Revelator is not a participant
            in the Great Game, he is its end. He is feared and reviled by the Warp-Predators that feed upon the Materium
            and each other. When it came to matters involving the Anathema, nothing was held back. Both sides fought to
            exterminate the other.<br>
            <br>
            This near eternal conflict continued in truly cataclysmic terms within Luna. The First Daemon Prince and the
            First Angel of Death sought to wipe destroy each other. Phenomenal psychic power, swords, and minds clashed
            in novas of power. The Angel&#x2019;s flesh was marred by many oily scars that oozed corruption, as was
            Be&#x2019;lakor with tongues of blue flame that refused to be extinguished. The core of Luna ws being
            superheated and cooled by clashing energies in a physics-defying battle. The only constant in the
            ever-shifting battlefield was the Rift. The crack, in reality, provided a peephole for the Gods to watch the
            battle. Its jagged edges spat incandescent lighting. Illuminating the warzone in impossible colors.<br>
            <br>
            A particularly brutal clash had sent both Angel and Daemon colliding into opposite ends of the chamber. The
            steel-shredding impact barely phased the two. Scrabbling from the impact-craters they flew across the
            Chamber. Reaching supersonic speeds, they smashed into each other, their weapons screaming for death of
            their opponent. With a mid-air feint, Be&#x2019;lakor spun and grabbed one of the Angel&#x2019;s wings and
            threw her into the chamber wall. A flurry of doombolts and curses followed the reeling Avatar of Sanity, and
            before she could recover all two stories of Be&#x2019;lakor landed on top of her wounded form. A taloned
            claw gripped the Angel&#x2019;s head and dragged her along the obsidian wall, grinding her burning flesh
            against the stone as he flew along it.<br>
            <br>
            Suddenly, gouts of flames erupted from the Angel, seering the warp-infused flesh of Be&#x2019;lakor. The
            Dark Prince was forced to let go of his foe, providing an opportunity for the Angel to ram her flaming
            greatsword through the Daemon&#x2019;s gut. The psychic flames burning away twisted flesh. Roaring in fury,
            Be&#x2019;lakor punched the Angel. The atmosphere detonated in a cavitation bubble tinged with Daemonic
            laughter. Floating back to her feet the Angel flew forwards and gripped her blades hilt. With a brutal
            upward stroke, she pulled it free and through the Daemon&#x2019;s mutant ribcage. Be&#x2019;lakor growled
            through the pain, and summon dark powers to combat the golden flames searing his flesh.<br>
            <br>
            The battle continued for hours, neither side capable of gaining an advantage. Their flesh and spirit healed
            as quick as they were damaged. But Be&#x2019;lakor could draw the fetid spring of corruption that was the
            Rift within Luna, and he knew that he would tire slower than his foe. A scrap of the soul once known as
            Sagitari-17 was entrapped in his stolen flesh. Tormented and mocked by the Daemon he had once served. He had
            believed himself chosen, elected by the divine. A rightful Sorcerer-Lord to enact the Gods will.
            Be&#x2019;lakor had lost count of the times he had claimed such fools as hosts. Across the galaxy and the
            ages, a thousand worlds had gone mad under the First Prince&#x2019;s whims, each tragedy ending with the
            warp-touched architects of extinction becoming his hosts and playthings. Sagitari-17 was just the next of
            this Chaotic epic.<br>
            <br>
            What puzzled Be&#x2019;lakor was the source of the Angels power. He could sense the Astronomicon helping
            stabilize it, but it was not its font of energy. While it was similar to an incarnated Daemon, flesh infused
            with Warp Energy, it was also decidedly different. Something unique and bizzare made it up. Similar to the
            Primarchs in some ways, but if they had a spark of it inside of them, this thing was a blazing inferno. The
            Angel and the Primarchs were indeed Warp-touched, in a way that was both experimentally new and impossibly
            ancient. The Anathema had crafted his tools of domination perfectly.<br>
            <br>
            The duel continued unabated, with Be&#x2019;lakor holding a slight advantage in power. Not enough to tip the
            balance decisively, but enough that he would eventually win. With the Warp-Rift feeding him the raw stuff of
            Chaos and the laws of physics fading in Luna, victory would be his. This tempo changed in a single moment.
            With a perfectly timed parry, the Angel had slashed its sword across the eight-sided rune on the
            Daemon&#x2019;s chest. The psychic flames that formed the sword leapt onto his flesh and sought to reduce
            him to ash. Instead of slowly fading to auric cinders that would be quenched by his ocean of malice, these
            flames only grew hotter. Burning away at the Daemon&#x2019;s flesh.<br>
            <br>
            The Angel&#x2019;s fire spread, leaping from its form like Solar flares. Everything it touched burned. The
            Warps touch was burned out of the materium, purged with callous disregard. The Angel&#x2019;s power was
            growing, and quickly. Soon, a corona of energy surrounded her. The Angel had become a Star. It took
            Be&#x2019;lakor no time to realize the source of this new power: The Emperor of Mankind had come to Luna.<br>
            <br>
            Where the Primarchs were power placed in flesh and filtered through a human soul, the Angel was nothing but
            unstoppable psychic energy barely contained in a saint&#x2019;s body. It existed only to destroy what the
            Emperor decreed an enemy. Eventually, if left unchained for too long, it would stop limiting itself. It
            would seek to serve the Emperor the only way it could; by destroying anything and everything it deemed
            unworthy or corrupt. It was a being made of pure order and domination, and few would escape its zealous
            judgment.<br>
            <br>
            So where Be&#x2019;lakor was limited by the Materium&#x2019;s stifling certainty, the Angel could only
            follow orders and do as the Emperor commanded. The Master of Mankind through Malcador had ordered it to stop
            Be&#x2019;lakor, cleanse Luna, and protect the untainted. It had followed these orders, and even now its
            fire coursed through the Lunar catacombs, burning out the chaotic corruption like a virus culled from a
            bloodstream.<br>
            <br>
            Now the Emperor&apos;s attention and will was focused through the Angel. Instead of a broken godling,
            Be&#x2019;lakor faced the Anathema himself. Using the Angel much like a normal psyker would a force weapon,
            the Emperor channeled his power through her and unleashed his fury. Blow after blow burned and broke
            Be&#x2019;lakor. His flesh was seared and his soul ravaged. With each world-ending strike, Be&#x2019;lakor
            was further broken.<br>
            <br>
            The mighty black wings that had once darkened the skies of countless worlds were ragged stumps. His limbs
            were torn off and burned. As the core of Luna burned with golden light, the Emperor-Angel gripped the Daemon
            by its throat and dragged it to the rift. Speaking through the Angel, the Emperor addressed the Daemon
            Prince and his gods.<br>
            <br>
            &#x201C;You are not gods. You are nothing but a disease. A blight on the soul of mankind, a curse inflicted
            in the First War. I will cleanse the Warp of you, and bring light and sanity to my people. Your armies have
            been broken. Hashut has been cast back to its pit. The Imperium has been girded against your taint. The
            laughter of thirsting gods is over. The Age of False-Gods is at an end. The Age of Mankind has
            begun.&#x201D;<br>
            <br>
            Thrusting Be&#x2019;lakor through the rift, the Emperor started to pour the psychic energy that made up the
            Angel into the Warp. The Angel was an unborn Primarch. It was divine essence not given humanity but simply
            weaponized. Now that Anathema-Power was being poured directly into the Warp. He sacrificed the Angel&#x2019;
            s very essence to inject his will into the deepest Realms of Chaos. Screaming in unimaginable pain and
            humiliation, Be&#x2019;lakor fled for its false-life, leaving the body of Sagitari-17 and seeking some dark
            pit to hide in.<br>
            <br>
            Still the Angel bled into the Warp. The gods screamed in horror and frantically sought to stop the
            poisoning. The warp rift in Luna had been opened from the darkest reaches of the Warp, the domain of Chaos
            itself. Here, they could twist existence and send the sons of Lorgar back in time. Here, the God-Emperor
            could not destroy the gate, only shut it. It was a breach in existence leading to the stronghold of Chaos. A
            place of great darkness, a place of power. Where Chaos was at its purest, unassailable, and invincible.
            Except for one thing, for the deeper the darkness, the brighter the light shines. The Angel&#x2019;s essence
            flooded into the heart of Chaos. The Emperor would never have been able to strike such a domain normally.
            The gods had opened the way, channeling their might to extinguish the Imperium. Instead, the Light of
            Salvation and Revelation struck the gods.<br>
            <br>
            The light burned away at each realm of chaos, exposing weaknesses in each domain and opening new cracks in
            the strongholds of disorder. The Chaos Gods felt the old rules of the Game change. The Anathema had cast a
            light in the deepest darkness and the Gods were afraid. Fear and desperation make fools of all of us and in
            that moment of panic, great cracks in the alliance known as Chaos Undivided were illuminated. The Emperor
            still held the attention of the Four but more of it was cast to their siblings. Opportunities became
            apparent as did flaws. The threat of the Anathema had not lessened, but the danger of a rival Ruinous Power
            had only increased. The Gods would be at war, stuck dueling each other while keeping an eye upon the
            Emperor. Self-Destruction is Chaos&apos;s very nature and when an opportunity presented itself the Four
            could not help themselves. Somewhere within the Warp an outcast watched this display and laughed. This
            misguided malice would aid the Emperor, and itself rise to join the Game.<br>
            <br>
            Reeling in horror, the Four frantically to utterly shut the rift. As space/time convulsed and the Warps
            power subsided the Angel pulled itself out of the rift. Still holding the burnt and broken husk that had
            once been Sagitari-17. As a final parting gift of spite, the Four spat an ember of evil into the failed
            servant. The last bits of the Cult leader&#x2019;s soul took control of his broken body just as it mutated
            into a rancid Chaos Spawn.<br>
            <br>
            Feeling the Angel dying the Emperor used the unborn Primarch for one final miracle. From its burnt body, a
            wave of golden flame lashed out. Pure Anathema to Chaos in the form of cleansing fire coursed through Luna,
            burning away any lingering touches of the Gods. Psychic engines and ritual chambers detonated in flames both
            real and immaterial. Cultists and daemonic infestations became ash. Unlucky loyalists who had failed to
            reach the untainted surface layers of Luna were scoured. The ones who survived would suffer the symptoms of
            soul-binding, unconnected to the choirs but damaged, and left in awe at the terrible might unleashed.<br>
            <br>
            Now within the burning cavern once home to the Inner Sanctum lies two beings radically different yet
            incredibly similar. An ashen Angel composed of the last few flickers of power and a mewling Warp-Spawn that
            cried bitter tears at its foolishness.<br>
            <br>
            The Primarchs and most of the lunar loyalists had made it to the surface. Where the corruption had already
            been scorched away by the XI Legions exorcist specialists. Marcus Augustio and Kalib Kraad, still carrying
            the body of Horus, arrived into the light of Sol just as a golden Stormbird touched down. When its gantry
            lowered. it seemed like a second Sun had erupted. The Emperor had arrived on Luna.<br>
