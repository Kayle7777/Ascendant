    Primarch: XVII Lorgar Aurelian <br />
    <br />
    Foster World: Colchis- Feudal Arid world that managed to survive the Old Night by making pacts with Warp Entities.
    Regressed from its Industrial history into zealotry and barbarism. Primordial Annihilator Thrall-Cults made up the
    State religion. <br />
    <br />
    Discovery: 14th- Uncontrolled Psychic powers allowed XVII to predict our arrival and interpreted it as a
    &#x201C;Divine&#x201D; message. Lead a religious war against the prime Colchisian cult and won through charisma and
    dogma instead of martial skill or strategy. We initially believed his purging of his home-worlds taint and
    enthusiastic loyalty to us were signs of XVII resisting corruption like I. We were extremely mistaken.<br />
    <br />
    Capabilities: Never refined his martial capabilities and seemed opposed to learning military tactics and skills.
    Preferred to use his Charisma, both psychic and natural to win battles. Formidable Psychic powers that were further
    enhanced by Warp-Corruption. Naturally dogmatic and a true believer in his cause, showed remarkable manipulative and
    social engineering talent.<br />
    <br />
    Legion: Word Bearers: Extremely fanatical, to an unhealthy degree. Would die or worse for their cause.
    Hyper-Sensitive to XVII charisma. Started as our Anti-cult force, with their neural programming keeping them strict
    followers of the Imperial Truth. Once converted by XVII they became Religious Zealots of the worst kind would commit
    unnecessary atrocities to feed the Pantheon. <br />
    <br />
    Heresy: Refused multiple messages, summons, and warnings to discontinue conversion of worlds to a doctrine
    worshiping us. Eventually, we were forced to castigate him and it became apparent XVII had been corrupted since
    theft and was a serious security risk. Our attempts to minimize fallout were partially successful and he was
    designated as one of the Acceptable Losses. <br />
    <br />
    Fate: After orchestrating the Consumption of XII by PA8, the Heresy War and accidentally creating the Imperial Cult
    XVII retreated into the Eldars Folly. Has delved deeper into the Warp and become utterly engrossed in the Warps
    corruption and pays little attention to the Material Realm.<br />
    <br />
    Conclusion: Extreme Failure- Should have been euthanized at Monarchia. Our hopes to give XVII a chance to redeem
    itself and fulfill its potential were destroyed. Indoctrinated by the Primordial Annihilator pathetically easily,
    XVII willingly sacrificed its sons and the galaxy to the Warp.
