    <b>Name: </b>MK II &#x201C;Legio&quot; Power Armor<br>
    <br>
    <b>Inventor/Manufaturer:</b> Martian Mechanicum<br>
    <br>
    <b>Technological Description and Capabilities:</b> The MK II armor is a vast upgrade over the Mk I Thunder Armor and
    the interim pseudo-models used in early Legion actions. Its armor and synth-muscles are vastly superior to anything
    previous. Capable of resisting explosives, directed energy and kinetic munitions to an extremely high degree. While
    making the Legionnaire stronger and faster. Its backpack is equipped with a minimized fusion reactor that powers the
    armor. Life support systems, inbuilt cogitators and a thruster system that relies on the reactors exhaust are also
    included. Advanced auto-senses a Comm Suite and tactical Cogitators are included in the Helmet. The neural interface
    is highly advanced and better syncs with the wearers Black Carapace with prolonged use.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Physical Description:</b> The armors plates are large easily replaceable segments of Ceramite. Its pauldrons are
    oversized, as typical of Imperial design. They move with the armor and house low-level Ion-shield generators. An
    experimental upgrade originating with the X Primarch. Its helm is an odd hybrid of ancient Terran Knight and Romu
    Empire design.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Limits:</b> The Mk II armor was designed to be a general issue and mass producible. It fulfills those goals well.
    Lacking any glaring weaknesses and any major strengths. More specialized armor will outperform it in their
    particular skill set.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Specialized Armor subtypes</b><br>
    <br>
    Karasu Class: Stripped down suit designed for stealth operations. Possessing weaker but quieter synth-muscles. Its
    sensor system is also more developed. Favored by the VIII and XIX Legions. Often deployed with Scout Squads.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Immitis Class: Sealed armor with thrust nozzles positioned on most of the Armors joints. Designed for void combat.
    With better Rad shielding. Along with traction spikes deployable from hands and feet for anchoring into a vessel or
    melee combat.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Amatshe Class: Heavily armored suits that straddle the line between Warsuit mechs and standard armor. Slower and
    more cumbersome than other suits. While not being uncomfortably large like a Dreadknight or Centurion suit. Favored
    in siege combat or other brutal war-zones.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Jaga Class: Jump-pack equipped aerodynamic armor. Used for Jump Infantry and aerial combat. Fastest mass produced
    armor with stronger neural ports for heightened sensory input. Due to its lighter and more sensitive nature, it is
    not as hardy as other suits and relies on the wearer&apos;s ability to dodge most blows.<br>
    <br>
    Wulfhart Class: Designed for long-term operations where regular maintenance and re-equipment is not always possible.
    Lacking in almost every aspect compared to the base Mk II. Being less armored and with fewer features. It makes up
    for this through sheer resilience of its systems and easily repairable nature. Favored by Scouts and forces lacking
    stable supply lines.<br>
    <br>
    Ueir Class: Armor meant for Pilots and Vehicle crews. Reasonably armored with enhanced life support systems.
    Enhanced Neural-links designed to allow the Astartes to interface with Machine-Spirts. Using the armor as an
    intermediary between the Astartes nervous system and the machines cogitators. Lacking in synth-muscle and sensor
    features.
