    Plugging away at Chapter Eight. Gonna be fun seeing the Thunder Warriors fighting in the Last Siege of the
    Ethnarchy. The timeline of the Unification Wars is bluntly a mess so I am gonna try to give some context to where we
    are in the timeline. <br>
    <br>
    About 80% of Terra has been conquered with a few holdouts remaining. Luna has been pacified and the Thunder Warriors
    are reduced to about an Astartes Legion in strength and are preparing for the final assault on the last major rival
    to the Imperium on Terra (The Ethnarchy) This will be the second to last major battle on Terra, with the Gaduare
    Massacre concluding the War. <br>
