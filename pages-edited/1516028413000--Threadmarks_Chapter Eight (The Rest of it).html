            <br />
            :Thirteen Hours Later and 37 Kilometers beneath Terras Surface:<br />
            <br />
            Ghota awoke to screaming alarms and the deep thudding of Bolter-fire. As he groggily struggled out of his
            restraints three things hit him at once. First, even with his advanced armors climate systems, he felt as if
            he was boiling alive. Second, a drug cocktail had been added to his usual pre-battle enhancers that knocked
            him and his Battle-Brothers out. Thirdly data feeds and tactical information was streaming into his
            helmet.<br />
            <br />
            Freeing himself he scanned his surroundings, He was the first to awaken in his termite. The rest of the
            First Five Retinues were steadily awakening. Yet Arik Taranis and his Praetorian Squad were missing.
            Confused and Disoriented Ghota begin to absorb the data pouring into his helm. Of the 50 termites that had
            been deployed seven had been lost on the descent, either to environmental stress or defense measures.<br />
            <br />
            The Termites each carried 500 Thunder Warriors and had surfaced seemingly at random into the Tempest
            Galleries Lower Depths. They were at the border between the planet&apos;s crust and mantle.<br />
            <br />
            Orders then came to Ghota telling him to rally the Retinue Squads around him and advance to a location
            approximately 5 klicks from there location. Settling into the mindset of a commander Ghota began to rally
            and rouse the various Thunder Warriors. Five squads of humanities finest warriors were prepped and prepared
            to exit their craft into whatever hell awaited them.<br />
            <br />
            Even though the Termites hull built to withstand swimming in seas of lava they could hear the noises of
            battle. Weapon Fire, tearing metal and near constant explosions. Unsealing the Blast-Ports the Thunder
            Warriors exited the Craft roaring with the fury of the Emperor made manifest.<br />
            <br />
            Their termite had punctured the cavern floor and the Blast-Ports allowed them to clamber down upon the
            obsidian chamber. The realm they had arrived in was a truly insane esoteric domain that brought to mind
            classical images of Hell from Old Earth religions.<br />
            <br />
            Lava poured out of the chamber floor and flowed upwards in a parody of a waterfall. Great rivers of molten
            metal floated above them, suspended and manipulated by colossal electromagnetic Spindles. Bolts of lighting
            and billowing clouds of energized atmosphere formed a colossal storm, a never-ending Hellish Tempest for
            which the Caverns were named for.<br />
            <br />
            Yet the sight that caught the eyes of the Thunder Warriors most was the battle being waged across the
            titanic cavern. Thousands of Warriors battled swarms of horrific arachnoid machines. They outclassed the
            Thunder Warriors in both size and numbers. Ghota looked on in shock as volleys of Plasma, Melta and Volkite
            rounds had basically no effect upon the Machines as they charged into the Thunder Warrior lines and
            butchered them with brutal mining implements.<br />
            <br />
            In Response, a squad of Thunder Warrior wielding thunder hammers smashed into the offending machines. With
            superhuman blows that were comparable to artillery strikes, the Retributors pushed back the machines all
            while letting out psychotic roars of fury.<br />
            <br />
            Ghotas troops all moved to join the battle but they had orders elsewhere. Barking orders Ghota managed to
            lead his squadron away from the fight towards there rendezvous point. Looking back he watched more and more
            of the battling Thunder Warriors break either physically or mentally from the stress of battle. Some dropped
            there weapons and charged ferally into battle while others simply slumped over mid-fight.<br />
            <br />
            The Thunder Warriors ducked into a smaller capillary tunnel that Grav-Scans indicated would lead them
            towards the center of the Galleries. The new armor helped them navigate the polished tunnel that had been
            bored out of the earth with molten steel. Despite there attempts to be subtle they met resistance. A small
            patrol swarm of Tempest-Machines attacked. Ghota brought his Thunder Hammer and Storm Shield to bear while
            barking orders to his Battle-Brothers: &quot;Solid projectiles only, aim for the joints. Paladins with me!
            Justicars cover us!&quot;<br />
            <br />
            Ghota roared with transhuman fury as he smashed into the first line of the Tempest Machines. His fellow
            Thunder Warriors followed suit with Chain-Weapons, Power-Axes, and Thunder Hammers. Blow after blow rained
            down on the Machines, shattering there hardy internal components and buckling exoskeletons designed to swim
            in lava.<br />
            <br />
            Some machines tried to climb along the tunnel walls to pincer the Paladins but the Justicars reigned death
            with Penetrator Bolt-Rounds preventing any such attempts to buckle the front line of warriors. Unlike the
            ailing berserkers in the main cavern, these squads were composed of the elite of the Thunder Legions.
            Warriors who had faced the worst horrors of the Age of Strife and won.<br />
            <br />
            Yet even these elites could feel their bodies wearing under the stress of battle. Ghota thought to himself
            as he barely dodged a Machines mono-molecular appendage blade &quot;This used to be so much easier&quot;<br />
            <br />
            After the brief firefight concluded the Thunder Warriors advanced. They had lost five warriors, their gear
            had been salvaged and they had been given Honored Deaths. Marching forward they stormed the tunnels.
            Eventually, after a few hours of navigating the volcanic Labrinth and tunnel skirmishes, they reached their
            destination.<br />
            <br />
            A grand chamber carved from Adamantium and inlaid with Obsidian stood before them. Ten tunnels lead into the
            chamber each turning into a silicate bridges that were suspended over a pool of molten metal that served as
            the chamber&apos;s floor. Ghota cautiously lead his Battle-Brothers towards the center of the chamber where
            the ten bridges intersected. As they neared it a deep rumbling growl echoed throughout the Chamber.<br />
            <br />
            In an explosion of Lava and lighting something colossal breached the Pools surface. Easily the size of a
            Titan its Black-Diamond scales shimmered and its mechanical opened letting forth a horrific roar. Deep
            within the bowels of the Old Earth, they had encountered a machine built to emulate the archetypal monster:
            The Dragon.<br />
            <br />
            As one the Thunder Warriors leveled their weapons and open fire on the Wyrm. The Machine returned the favor
            with blasts of superheated plasma and metal that atomotized any Warrior unlucky enough to be hit. It&apos;s
            serpentine body wrapped around one of the bridges seeking to crush the scattering Warriors. Ghota bellowed
            commands as he internally cursed himself. He had followed the orders to leave the breaking and broken
            Warriors to there doom so they would act as a distraction while they headed to the inner core of the
            Galleries. Why had they been brought into this Trap?<br />
            <br />
            Suddenly a war-cry comparable in both volume and fury to the Dragons roar pierced the Chamber. Arriving from
            the opposite tunnel Arik Taranis: the Throne Slayer alongside his Praetorians had arrived. With a
            Paragon-Blade handcrafted by the Emperor himself in one hand and a Thunder Hammer in the other Taranis
            leaped at the beast. Moving with speed and skill unrivaled except for Valdor and the Emperor himself Taranis
            Jumped off the bridge onto the Dragon.<br />
            <br />
            Using his Blade as a parody of a Climbing-Spike he scrambled up the Machines side, leaving deep gouges in
            its exoskeleton as he went. The Lord of the Thunder Warriors shouted over the Vox for his forces to open
            fire at the Machines sensors. Obliging there Commanders will Ghota and the Praetorians emptied countless
            rounds into the Wyrms eyes and face. In response it attacked more violently, pulverizing entire squads of
            Thunder Warriors with a single lash of its tail.<br />
            <br />
            Undeterred Arik Taranis proved his mettle as Champion of the Emperor by reaching the Machines head. Slashing
            its left sensors and leaving his blade stuck within its glassen eye he propelled himself to stand between
            the creatures horns. Roaring with the fury of a Storm-God of ancient Myth he brought the Thunder Hammer down
            upon the beasts mechanical skull.<br />
            <br />
            With a blow that would have shattered a mountain-range, he split open the Volcanic Dragons skull. Imploding
            its Silicon based brain and shattering most of its internal machinery. The Chamber shook with the blow and
            cracks spread across the Adamantium walls. Leading out a death howl the Dragon began to slump over. Arik
            Taranis dislodged his Sword from the monster&apos;s corpse and rode its collapse onto one of the bridges.<br />
            <br />
            Stepping off the corpse onto the Bridges without making even note of the impossible feat he had just done
            Arik Taranis checked his Helms display and lead his Sons out of the Dragons Lair, and into the Inner Sanctum
            of the Master of the Galleries.<br />
            <br />
            Ghota caught up with his Commander and simply asked &quot;This is it isn&apos;t? The Final Mission?&quot;
            Instead of responding Arik turned to the 300 or so remaining Thunder-Warriors and spoke:<br />
            <br />
            &quot;My Sons, we have long known our end was nigh. We have served the Emperor valiantly in the quest for
            unification but we were not built to conquer the Stars nor protect humanity as its finest soldiers. Nay, we
            were forged to destroy and crush the worst of the Old Night as Warriors! We are dying, all of us and our
            Emperor has given us an opportunity. The Opportunity to not go out as deceased weaklings, but as
            Warriors!&quot;<br />
            <br />
            This truth dawned on them and as one the last of the Thunder Legions roared in triumph and celebration.
            Together they marched into the center of the Tempest galleries. The Dragon had been the last line of defense
            for there foe, now a simple pair of Adamantium-Alloy doors stood before them. Arik turned to his advisor and
            Equerry and said: &quot;Ghota, would you do the honors?&quot; A deep animal grim split Ghotas face as
            replied &quot;gladly sir&quot; He charged the doors and with all his might he smashed them open with a
            titanic blow of his Thunder-Hammer.<br />
            <br />
            Before them stood a titanic Machine. An impossibly advanced Abominable Intelligence that screamed in binary
            for its guardians and caretakers to return to it. Arik has slain numerous such monsters throughout the
            unification wars and he knew the simplest way to. Casually as if he was tossing an empty nutrient canister
            into disposal he lobbed a collection of Vortex Grenades into the Chamber.<br />
            <br />
            The Warp opened up and swallowed the colossal machine. With the maestro of the Galleries gone they started
            to collapse almost instantly. Machines that had functioned perfectly for millennia ground to a stop and
            started to buckle. Service and Defense Machines stopped mid-movement and collapsed like puppets with there
            strings cut.<br />
            <br />
            As soon as they had confirmed the A.I.&apos;s destruction the Thunder Warriors began there retreat. Entire
            Chambers began to collapse around them as more and more of the ancient complex buckled under the fury of
            Terra&apos;s core. They moved with superhuman speed, back towards the termites. Giving honorable deaths to
            the wounded so they would not slow them down.<br />
            <br />
            At last, they reached one of the operational vehicles and the Thunder Warriors entered there only escape.
            Frantically they tried to start the damaged machine and after a few horrifying seconds were the chamber
            began to buckle around them and the Cogitator responded. Using pre-programmed orders the Termites
            automatically burrowed out of the chamber and headed for the surface.<br />
            <br />
            Once they seemed well on their way and the horrors and insanity of the Tempest galleries were kilometers
            behind them Ghota sat beside Arik and asked: &quot;Where were you when I awoke?&quot; Removing his helmet
            the ancient warrior looked at his second with tired eyes as he spoke: &quot;I needed to make arrangements,
            Those who were already falling apart needed to be put down less they endanger us all and those who were
            closest to the brink needed to be arranged so even if they went mad during the battle they would do their
            duty.&quot;<br />
            <br />
            Looking out at the Thunder Warriors surrounding him he continued &quot;Even the selected few to carry out
            the mission are at risk. Keep an eye out on the trip home Ghota, we are not safe yet.&quot; The Thunder
            Warriors removed their armor and began to socialize. Telling stories and comparing records of battles and
            tales. Hours ticked by and for a tragically brief period of time the Warriors enjoyed the camaraderie and
            companionship afforded only too brothers in arms.<br />
            <br />
            Sadly such solace was not to last. Tragedy struck when Decimator Baktash begins to tell a story of how he
            had been part of the frontline charge with Gardus Steelsoul against the Cyber-Thralls of the Droog-Lord.
            &quot;There we were, all Five thousand of us against the rotten bastards when...when...when&quot;
            Baktash&apos;s eyes glazed over and for a split second the sheer weight of the horrors he had seen and
            perpetrated crashed into his decaying mind. He let loose a pained howl and lept at one of his brothers.<br />
            <br />
            Baktash sunk his fingers into the eyes of one of his closest comrades and bit open the main artery of his
            squad&apos;s officer before he was put down. Within the relatively cramped chamber, the stink of blood and
            battle-hormones was thick. A painful silence filled the Termite before another Thunder Warrior began to
            shake with hallucinations of long distant foes. He was put down almost instantly and the smell of blood and
            sight of the dead began to worm its way into the minds of the Thunder Warriors.<br />
            <br />
            For another hour tense silence and fear cast a pall over the surviving Thunder Warriors. The quite was
            broken by the ugly sound of breaking bones. A Warrior fell to his knee as his left tibia and fibula
            shattered funder the power of his own tensed muscle. That proved to be the final straw.<br />
            <br />
            Carnage erupted as half-mad berserkers lept at their brothers who could feel the same madness creeping into
            their minds as they fought off there deranged former friends and Battle-Brothers. Arik and Ghota were back
            to back as veterans of the Unification Wars butchered each other in a wholesale slaughter brought on by
            disease and trauma.<br />
            <br />
            It was a gruesome melee, there weapons and armor were locked away so the battle was conducted with hands,
            feet, and teeth. Ghota screamed with futile rage as he crushed one of his Squad Mates skulls all while
            impotently begging him to regain some semblance of sanity. Arik kept calm simply saying over and over
            &quot;this would be a good death&quot; as he slaughtered his Sons. Yet after nearly an hour of feral combat,
            all that was left in the Termite alive was Arik covered head to toe in his Gene-Sons blood and a wounded
            Ghota slumped against the wall. Speaking more to himself than Ghota or the corpse that pooled around them
            Arik softly said &quot;But not good enough&quot;<br />
            <br />
            Ghota patched himself up with the medical supplies available and watched Arik carefully. After a bit, Ghota
            asked, &quot;Why am I still alive.&quot; He had watched the carnage and madness overtake his Brothers but it
            had not claimed him. Shrugging his soldiers Taranis responded: &quot;Luck of the draw, one in a billion odds
            of being especially compatible with the Augments.&quot;<br />
            <br />
            Ghota had never inquired much about his Commanders past and history, that was not his duty but he decided
            there was nothing to lose and asked. &quot;So you&apos;re like me a one in a billion?&quot; Looking back at
            Ghota Arik wore as quizzical look. &quot;I figured you were smarter than that and would have figured it out
            in all these long years.&quot; In a display of sudden surprising rage, he ripped off his breastplate to show
            Ghota the mark tattooed over his heart. It was barely visible beneath the pattern of scars on his chest. It
            was the Gothic Numeral for Zero within a twin headed bird of prey.<br />
            <br />
            In a voice that was a mix of anger and strangely pride, he spoke of his creation and purpose. &quot;I was
            crafted by the Emperor himself as the First of the Thunder Legions, and Gene-Sire of them. The prototype for
            his true-born creations and doomed to die along with my sons thanks to being an unfinished thing.&quot;
            Throwing his battered plumed helm to the floor the gigantic warrior collapsed next to Ghota and continued.
            &quot; I was sworn to secrecy, to never tell the fate I knew was mine for I had a duty to do.&quot;<br />
            <br />
            Stunned Ghota asked &quot;Then why are you telling me this? If the Emperor himself swore you to secrecy then
            why?&quot; A Cruel smirk appeared on Ariks lips &quot;Cause Frak him and his scheming manipulative
            egotistical ways.&quot;Ghota was still stunned at the plainly treacherous words and before another word
            could be said Arik started to laugh. A deep growling noise that seemed impossibly at odds at the scene of
            blood and carnage surrounding them.<br />
            <br />
            &quot;I have waited literal centuries to say that damn sentence Ghota. CENTURIES! The Emperor of Mankind is
            an egotistical manipulative control freak who spends lives like currency and subtly controls everything
            around him. Yet the worst part, the absolute worst part of the Grox-plowing bastard is he is right. What he
            does is the best damn way forward and he knows it.&quot; With those words, Arik Taranis: The Throne Slayer
            admitted the truth of his Master.<br />
            <br />
            Eight hours later at a Dormant Volcano near Klostzatz the Termite broke the surface. It was quickly detected
            by Imperial Scouts who had been waiting for it. The message made its way back to the dying battlefields of
            the Caucasus Wastes, where the Imperium was finishing off the last remnants of the Ethnarchy. The Emperor
            had just finished overseeing the transport of the Ethnarch himself to Khangba Marwu when the message
            arrived.<br />
            <br />
            Flanked by Custodians, Remembrancer and various hangers on the Emperor arrived at the sight of the surfaced
            Termite. Soon after they did The main Blast-Port opened up and Twin figures clambered out. Arik with Ghota
            slung over his shoulder. Slowly they approached the Emperor. A cluster of medics swarmed Ghota looking to
            patch up the wounded Warrior. Ensuring his Equerry was in good hands Arik Taranis walked up to the
            Emperor.<br />
            <br />
            Creator and Creation stared at each other for a solid second before Arik struck the Master of Mankind with a
            punch that would have cracked open a main battle tank. It mildly fazed the Emperor and before even
            Taranis&apos;s transhuman senses could detect twelve guardian spears hovered above his vital spots. To that
            Arik simply gruffly shouted, &quot;Fine then, do it!&quot;<br />
            <br />
            The Custodes almost obliged before the Emperor stopped them. In a voice filled with somber aloofness, the
            Emperor spoke to the Ur-Primarch. &quot;No Arik, the Thunder Legions war may be over but you still have a
            role to play.&quot;
