            Primarch: XVIII Vulkan<br>
            <br>
            Foster World: Nocturne - A Volcanic Death World settled by a group of genetically modified Pacifists during
            the Golden Age. Part of a binary with its oversized moon Prometheus. The Gravitational interplay between the
            twin bodies causes extreme tectonic instability on Nocturne. The Wildlife was almost as equally dangerous as
            the environment and the people learned to survive this harsh world within their Sanctuary Cities. <br>
            <br>
            Discovery: 6th - Was one of the three that required us to best them in competition. We used it as an
            opportunity to test XVIII&#x2019;s physical and intellectual skills. We considered allowing XVIII to fail
            the last test and perish in order to activate his abilities. Decided to save him to ensure loyalty.<br>
            <br>
            Capabilities: One of the most physically powerful Primarch. Possessing endurance, durability, and strength
            virtually unmatched among the others. Slightly slower and more ponderous in comparison to projected
            baseline. Most likely side effect of upbringing on high Gravity death world. Extremely inventive with
            fundamental knowledge inbuilt into him. High morality and ethics thanks to genetic and cultural factors.
            Perfect for our purposes.<br>
            <br>
            Legion: Salamanders: Durable, loyal and inventive as their gene-father. Served with distinction during both
            Crusade and Unification. Almost wiped out due to extensive casualties before XVIII was found and again
            during the Drop Site Massacre. Survive to this day and serve with distinction and atypical compassion.<br>
            <br>
            Heresy: Was one of the three Loyal Primarchs betrayed at the Drop Site Massacre. Was captured by VIII and
            tortured into insanity. Managed to escape to Ultramar and was kept by XIII at his Contingency Empire. Was
            seemingly killed by the Cabals plots but the use of the Fulgurite allowed us to extend our influence on him
            and craft our contingencies.
            <br>
            <br>
            Fate: After assisting in the Destruction of a Beast class WAAAGH he made his way back to the Imperial Palace
            and awaits the day the Terminus Decree is used. If such an event does occur the Artifacts of Vulkan if
            gathered together can be used to summon him from Terra&#x2019;s ashes to lead humanity. <br>
            <br>
            Conclusion: Success- Was created as a contingency and tool to not only preserve the human species but its
            humanity. As solid as the Old Earth the kindest soul is prepared to do great evil and good if it means the
            survival of our people.
