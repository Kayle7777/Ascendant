    I have to make the Legions bigger. The Canon 40k universe just handles numbers so damn poorly. To match up to the
    numbers and power of various rising human powers along with threats like the growing WAAAGHs and the Rangdans
    I&apos;ve got to scale them up. The Legions were not the strike force of the 41st millennia but the main battle
    troops. The Imperial Army was an occupation force with cannon fodder uses. The Solar Auxilla were just that
    Auxillia. The Legio Astartes were the main army of the Great Crusade. I am basically going to retcon it so while
    Astartes are one-man-armies they fight in numbers more fitting for such a massive sci-fi setting. So expect million
    strong Legions and battles involving hundreds of thousands of Astartes duking it out with never-ending Xeno
    hordes.<br>

    ^ A Reddit post i made explaining the math and massive size disparity in 40k.<br>
    <br>
    So, in summary, I am not nerfing the Astartes but simply scaling up the numbers of the conflicts to seem more
    galactic war than a tabletop game. Chapter 16 is coming along, the next part will hopefully be up in a few days.<br>

    Edit- Currently thinking low millions for each Legions in number
