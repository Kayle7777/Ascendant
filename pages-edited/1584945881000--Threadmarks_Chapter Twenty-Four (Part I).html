            Instein-Relativism&#x201D;</u
        ></i
    ><br />
    <br />
    The development of the Imperial Astropathic network was one of the most important and substantial tasks of the early
    Imperium and required hundreds of thousands of psykers to be soul-bonded in massive rituals within the City of
    Sight. This act created a system of telepathic communication that could reliably connect the distant worlds of the
    Imperium. Allowing effective faster than light communication to bridge the stars. Yet the development of this
    network of choirs and relays served more purposes than simple communication. It allowed for a feat of relativistic
    linkage unseen even during the Age of Silicon Technology. <br />
    <br />
    Faster than light communication was possible through a myriad of practices, ranging from consecrated to heretical
    with numerous methods available to the Imperium and used across its broad domains such as Entangled Data-Cores,
    Noosphere bonds, Grav-dar, and of course the Astropathic system. With all of the options available to it, the
    Imperium primarily used the resource-intense system of astropaths. That requires a near-constant supply of psykers
    to High Terra for soul-bonding and training. The reason for engaging in this costly system is the Astropathic
    System&#x2019;s ability to effect Instien-Relativism. <br />
    <br />
    Instien-Relativism is the ancient Terran astrophysics term for how gravity and energy/matter effect time. The closer
    one gets to light speed, the slower time moves and how this relates to gravity and space/time. This means that time
    flows at different rates across the galaxy. One Terran year passing in the Sol System might be minutes or decades in
    other star systems. <br />
    <br />
    Even at the height of the Age of Silicon, the problems related to this phenomenon were never fully addressed. Entire
    sectors and human civilizations existed in radically different flows of time, increasing the already fractured
    nature of humanity across the galaxy. The Silicon Age Federation of Mankind was never truly successful in fully
    synchronizing their perception of time. They chose to rely on Abominable Intelligences capable of thinking and
    calculating at such rates that the differences could be minimized. When the Age of Strife ignited the death throes
    of the Federation, the progress made to the end of unifying &#x2018;human time&#x2019; was obliterated and the
    extensive uses of Chrono and Datavore weapons during the Iron War only made the problem worse.<br />
    <br />
    This left the Emperor of Mankind (Augustus Imperator, hallowed be his Light) with a unique problem. He needed
    mankind to be unified under his Aegis and form the Imperium of Man. Yet such a centralized and monolithic entity
    could not exist with different timescales across itself. Having an Empire fractured in such a way left it open to
    countless threats. The Imperium needed to operate at the same time scale or extremely close. This is where the
    Astropath systems come in. Astropaths perform Faster than Light communication not by exploiting some fundamental
    aspect of reality but circumventing it entirely. Using the impossibility of the Warp to communicate across vast
    distances. This long-range telepathy has a curious effect on space/time. When the connection is made from one
    astropath to another the flow of time between the two synchronizes. <br />
    <br />
    This allows Astropaths to force entire star-systems thousands of light-years apart to experience time the same. This
    property is what makes the Astropathic system so incredibly important. A chain of Astropaths starting on High Terra
    and ending in the far reaches of the galaxy will experience time at nearly identical rates. The only delays are
    caused by Warp phenomena and the time it takes for one Astropath to dictate a message to another, letting the
    Imperium calculate time-based on Terran Standard and accounting for the minor shifts in Astropath connections.
    <br />
    <br />
    When the Imperium adds a new system into itself, that system joins the rest of the Imperium in chronological
    consistency. During the Great Crusade, the great fleets of the Primarchs left chains of time-corrected systems in
    their wake, applying Imperial Law and reality to the galaxy itself. Systems that had been centuries to even
    thousands of years out of line with Imperial Standard time found themselves bound to mankind once again by shared
    chronology. The Imperium of Man is the greatest achievement of our species. This is but one example of the
    Emperor&#x2019;s (Augustus Imperator, hallowed be his light) genius, the bountiful resources of the galaxy and the
    hard work of billions across the stars. Working together to bind even time to our collective will. <br />
    <br />

    <i><u>Sample texts from: &#x201C;Homo sapiens rotundus: Imperial Primer on the Coreworld Peoples&#x201D; </u></i
    ><br />
    <br />
    During the Ages of Expansion, when mankind spread throughout the galaxy, the peoples who settled in the mineral-rich
    worlds of the Galactic Core became renowned for their hardiness and sheer persistence. They survived in the
    unforgiving environment of the Coreworlds despite the natural and unnatural dangers involved. They dug great
    subterranean strongholds into the high-gravity rock of their newfound Homeworlds, facing incredible risks from the
    unstable rock and pressure of these planets. They dug deep into mineral riches that helped forge the ancient human
    civilizations of the Galaxy. <br />
    <br />
    The Coreworlds are extremely hazardous and even the most simple of mining operations could have upwards of fifty
    percent mortality. This is not even counting the dangers of the Orkish hordes that periodically raid the Coreworlds
    or the nearby threat of the Maelstrom. Extensive use of cloning and accelerated gestation was required to keep the
    strongholds populated, with the genome of the most successful and skilled Coreworlders being used to create the next
    generation. Genetic tweaking, though frowned upon, was not unheard of across the Strongholds. This process assisted
    the Coreworlders in growing denser bones and stronger muscles to help in the high gravity. Additionally, the
    intricate system of mines and caverns used by these settlers required exceptional memory and spatial awareness.
    Their ability to accurately estimate direction and purpose of frequently damaged tunnels being the only thing saving
    them from horrible deaths. <br />
    <br />
    These factors lead to extraordinary evolutionary and cultural pressure to produce durable, hardworking, methodical
    and borderline obsessive humans of short stature. This combined with the extreme chrono-dilation found close to the
    Galactic Core led to the development of an abhuman sub-race of mankind. The heavy worlds of the Galactic Core
    experienced time at a vastly accelerated rate compared to most of the galaxy and the strongholds within them
    experiencing decades to even centuries for every Terran year. <br />
    Even with these drastic chrono-dialations, the Core-Worlds kept in close contact with the rest of Mankind. With a
    steady stream of new migrants, technologies, and culture flowing in and out of the Core-Worlds. The chrono-dilations
    still had major noticeable effects. With every new trade-ship encountering an entirely new generation and in some
    cases cultural period of Core-Worlders when it docked. Doing business and operating with the outside galaxy was
    hampered by this, with Terran Ships arriving at a Stronghold after a few years of travel, demanding a mining
    contract fulfilled. When the stronghold in question had been plunged into civil-war lasting decades and the company
    the contract was signed with had been destroyed years earlier.<br />
    <br />
    The consequences of incidents like these forged an honor-bound and communal culture into the Core-Worlders. Who had
    gained the semi-affectionate nickname as the &#x201C;Squats&#x201D; for their increasingly shorter stature when
    compared to most Human strains. The responsibilities and wealth of individuals were bound to their extended families
    in great Clans. With monolithic Guilds replacing the unstable network of corporations, workers-communions, and
    mining-colonies. With oaths, contracts and the general business of these organizations viewed as matters of
    generations of workers, instead of temporary members. The stubborn obsessiveness bred into the Squats by the
    difficulties of Heavy-World life combined with this idea of generational responsibility to produce cultural values
    of extreme-diligence and work. With entire linages working on a project or venture. Doing everything they could to
    ensure the quality of it, and ensuring their descendants were capable of continuing the work.<br />
    <br />
    These factors led the galaxy to value the industries of the Core-Worlds as much or if not more than its mineral
    wealth. With the products of a century of a Squat Clan being of equal quality to those produced by Abominable
    Intelligences. Along with the heart and soul of its creators being poured into the creation in ways a thinking
    machine could never replicate. A combination of genetic engineering and the success of clans with large quantities
    of Old-Masters started to increase the Squat lifespan past standard humans, with Squats being capable of living
    multiple centuries without the use of rejuveanut treatments. <br />
    <br />
    When the Iron Wars of Dread Silicon and the Fall of the Aeldari happened, the Core Worlds suffered like the rest of
    mankind. Countless strongholds were lost to insane thinking machines and the growth of the Maelstrom. The
    chrono-dilation had the unexpected side effect of limiting the disastrous effects of the Abominable Intelligences
    collapse. With the relatively insular and increasingly tradition-bound Squats shirking many of the more powerful
    Silicon-monsters that entranced the rest of Mankind. Putting more faith in (ab)human grit and spirit than shoddy
    machines. <br />
    <br />
    The psychic awakening of mankind was not unfelt among the Squats as well. With some of the Strongholds close to the
    Maelstrom falling to the call of Chaos. Others were cursed with mutation and were exiled from their Strongholds.
    These Brotherhoods of Exiles were given fleets of mining vessels and countless tokens from their Clans. Fearing the
    spread of the mutations these exiles left the Core-Worlds and sought to make new worlds for themselves to live upon.
    Within the majority of the Squat-Holds, the development of psychic powers occurred differently. Instead of a
    semi-random eruption of people with higher emotional activity becoming Warp-Touched. A handful of the oldest Crafts
    Folk and Clan Elders suddenly found themselves awash with psychic energy.<br />
    <br />
    These elders were some of the most strong-willed and capable of the Squat subspecies. Who found themselves able to
    master these powers relatively easily when compared to most humans. At the price of being on average less powerful
    and in some ways effective with these newfound Psychic abilities. As the Age of Strife bore on, more of these elders
    started to gain psychic powers. A handful across the strongholds every year. The existing psychic-elders also seemed
    to stop-aging, and steadily increase in psychic power as the decades wore on. While still capable of death by injury
    or calamity as one would expect from withered ancients, their minds and skills were further sharpened by age.
    Ancestor Worship had grown into the semi-official faith among the Core-Worlds and the advent of these &#x201C;Living
    Ancestors&#x201D; as they became known only solidified the status of this religion. With many Living Ancestors
    claiming they could feel the power and protection of generations of Squats infused in whatever their people built.
    <br />
    <br />
    For the Solar System, the Age of Strife was five thousand years of darkness and horror. For the Squats it was
    something more like twenty or thirty thousand. With the densely packed stars of the Core-Worlds and the
    generation-ships of the Squats allowing the strongholds to keep together and even lend aid during this time. Yet
    anything from outside the ring of Squat systems around the Galactic Core was almost completely unknown. What
    information did get through was tale after tale of strife and horror. The few expeditions that returned told of
    entire worlds burning in madness. Storm Ghosts (Squat term for Warp predators) haunting entire star systems and
    clashing at the mouths of a thousand miniature Maelstroms. Worse still were accounts of Xeno Horribilis on the move,
    with Orkish hordes in specific rampaging through the stars in horrific numbers. The crone-worlds of the Aeldari
    wiped from existence and no contact from the Craftworlds the Squats had regular communication with.<br />
    <br />
    For those long millennia of the Old Night, the strongholds persisted. They reforged themselves into coalitions
    called Leagues. Severed from Terra, and with Sol a distant myth, the Squats viewed the Core Worlds as their
    homeworlds. A harsh realm of black holes, dying stars and wealth beyond measure that they would hold for all time.
    Such was the split from the rest of the Galaxy that the Coreworlders started to refer to themselves as the
    Khazakhun, instead of Humans. A term in the local dialects meaning &#x2018;Deep Survivors&#x2019;. At first, the
    Squat Leagues experienced something of a renaissance. With new technology developed to replace what was lost during
    the Iron War and new Strongholds founded across the Homeworlds, each League grew into close-knit pseudo-nations.
    They were bound by pacts of trade and defense but still very independent. Of course, not everything was peaceful
    during this age of isolation. Squabbles over mining rights, matters of honor and other such matters lead to great
    feuds forming between the Leagues. <br />
    <br />
    War between Leagues never broke out aside from a few small skirmishes. To turn blade or bolt upon kinsfolk was
    considered the gravest crime by the Ancestors. However, honor was still held above all, with deep resentment brewing
    between leagues and factions. With the bitterness of these slights poisoning the hearts and minds of the Squats.
    Culturally and genetically, the Stronghold&apos;s peoples were trained to be obsessive and blunt. With the idea of
    unsettled grudges gnawing away at the psyche of Squats. A cultural innovation of the Grudgekeepers was born to deal
    with this problem. The dishonored and criminal were used as living tomes of bitter memories. Living Ancestors could
    transfer the pain and stress into the Grudgekeepers, who became a living embodiment of the rage and grief of the
    Squat People. Each Stronghold holds at least one Grudgekeeper, with some larger ones having thousands. All those who
    failed their holds and clans. Bearing the sins and suffering of others as penance. <br />
    <br />
    This development could not have come at a better time. With the Strongholds, and their larger planet-sprawling
    brethren of holds soon facing the greatest threat yet. An Orkish Warboss of particular cunning brutality had set its
    sight upon the Squat Homeworlds. Grunhag the Flaya as he called himself followed the Orkish
    &#x201C;philosophy&#x201D; (if such a word can ever be applied to the Greenskins) of &#x201C;Tota WAAAGH!&#x201D;
    While all Orks exist solely for the goal of fighting and winning. The definition of such concepts varies across the
    Orkish hordes. Grunhag believed the only true victory was to utterly and horrifically destroy his foes. While true
    sadism is rare among the Greenskins, their origin as a living weapon and their distorted view making their
    understanding of the cosmos radically different from noble human thought. Grunhag is one of the exceptions to this
    rule, being a truly cruel and malicious being who derived great pleasure from ruination and petty malice.<br />
    <br />
    The Warboss&#x2019; brutality and atypical thoroughness in making war allowed him to amass a colossal WAAAGH! Unlike
    his cousins at Ullanor or Gorro. Grunhag had little desire to build thuggish fiefdoms. Instead, he led billions of
    Orks in a migratory wave of death that was responsible for the complete destruction of multiple pockets of mankind
    and Xeno species. Stripping the planets taken from the Orks foes of anything of value or interest. Leaving barren
    husks populated with scant Orkish fungoides living in the ruins of civilizations butchered down to the last man,
    women, and child. <br />
    <br />
    Growing bored of the scattered fragments of culture that proved little challenge for him, Grunhag turned his bestial
    intelligence towards the Squat homeworlds. The stalwart civilization residing in the Galactic core seemed a perfect
    challenge. Declaring the dread warcry of WAAAGH!!! Grunhag rallied the largest body of Orks found outside the
    Beast-Boss Empires. Looking to crack open the diamond-hard worlds of the Squats and loot the technological and
    mineral wealth within. Which admittedly was a secondary goal compared to fighting the infamously determined and
    mighty Squats. Breaking the &#x201C;Puny Stunties&#x201D; under the crushing fists of Gork and Mork.<br />
    <br />
    When the Orkish war fleets first entered the Squat Homeworlds they were hailed by the mighty Generation-Ships of the
    Squats that patrolled their piece of the galaxy. Demanding an explanation for the Orkish fleet and their intent. To
    us, the idea of attempting to discuss anything with an Ork is utterly ridiculous. The closest the Greenskins have to
    diplomacy is how high up you are on their priorities to fight. Yet ancient records from the Age of Silicon indicate
    the Orks might not have always been as vicious as they are. Still warlike and brutal there are a surprising number
    of accounts with successful trade occurring. The Squats especially had a reputation for this. With stories of Orkish
    WAAAGH!!!s and Squat Mercenary Brotherhoods having bizarre working relationships as Soldiers of Fortune during the
    Age of Silicon. It seems most Orks found the brutal siege work needed to claim Squat Holds boring. With the Squats
    able to easily convince the Orks with a few token gifts and directions to a nearby enemy for them to fight. Not to
    attack the Strongholds. Still, the reason for this shift in the Orks to purely aggressive and near-feral barbarism
    is unknown. <br />
    <br />
    In typical Orkish fashion, the Greenskins responded with a deafening storm of roars, curses, and threats. Prompting
    the Generation Ships confronted by the Orks to transmit warning across the Homeworlds of the impending invasion. The
    Generation Ships were brutally wiped from the Void by the Orks. The superior weapons and armor of the Squat design
    insufficient to deal with the Greentide. Thankfully the warning did not go unheeded. Across the Galactic Core
    thousands of Strongholds and systems prepared for battle. The mighty Generation Ships that ply the Core with short
    warp-jumps and gravitic skipping. Assembled to face the oncoming WAAAGH!!! <br />
    <br />
    A council of Living Ancestors, Guild Masters, and Hold-Lords assembled within each League. Planning the defense of
    each network of Strongholds and the entire Homeworlds. Even the smallest Strongholds were fortified and defended
    immaculately. The Dangers of the Age of Strife and existence upon these Heavy-Worlds had forced the Squats to master
    the art of defensive warfare. This factor would be central to the Squat strategy. The Strongholds would become
    anvils to pin the Orks in place, allowing the Generation Fleet to strike wherever the Greenskins were weakest.
    <br />
    <br />
    The masterful skill of the Squat Void-Masters reaped a grim toll upon the Orks. Who did not seem to mind at all.
    Happy to engage in the brutal warfare they were built for. Squat splinter fleets were used to lure the Orkish fleet
    towards the most heavily defended Strongholds and away from their weaker kin. The Squat fleet fought much as they
    mine. Using powerful ordinance to blast holes in the Orkish battle lines. Splintering the greenskin
    &#x201C;formation&#x201D; letting hulking armored Squat Ships charge the displaced parts of the Orkish Fleet.
    Grinding them to dust with withering fire and in some cases weaponized mining equipment. The powerful Las-Drills
    used by Squat void-rigs were designed to punch through Asteroids. Space-Hulks and Orkish &#x201C;Roks&#x201D; was
    similar enough. <br />
    <br />
    The first battles went well for the Khazkhun Alliance as the united Squats called themselves. With millions of Orks
    and their ships directing their wrath on the Diamond hard Strongholds of the Squats. The battles that took place
    during these mighty sieges were legendary. Such as when the Land Train Dureks Shield dueled a dozen Gargants to
    protect a supply convoy traveling between strongholds. Or when the Hearthguard of Gorri Rock-Skull held a
    compromised mine-shaft for three weeks by themselves. <br />
    <br />
    Yet these efforts were not enough to stem the tide of Greenskins. The Orks applied the entire force of the WAAAGH!!!
    To each individual stronghold, they attacked. To claim any individual stronghold took years or even decades of
    fighting. Slowing the Orkish offense to a crawl, but a steady one. This suited Grunhag the Flaya just fine it
    seemed. The Ork took great enjoyment in watching each Stronghold weaken and die under his armies chokehold. Grinding
    the deep-homes of the Squats to ash and dust. The sheer bloodshed and aggression the Orks were producing, had a
    twofold effect. Calling out through the Warp to the Greenskins of the Galaxy. Attracting billions more Greenskins
    from the Beast-Boss Empires and scattered lesser WAAAGH!!! Secondly, it dredged the Neverborn spawn of Khorne (PA8)
    into the Squat Homeworlds. With some entire Strongholds losing their minds to the bloody whispers of the Warp.
    Throwing open their gates and charging to death against the Orks. <br />
    <br />
    The continuous materialization of Neverborn and the possession of some Orks are theorized to have been part of
    Grunhags plan. The Neverborn and &#x201C;unOrky&#x201D; Orks providing plenty of entertainment for the WAAAGH!!!
    during the slow periods of the Sieges. By Orkish, and even human standards Grunhag was something of a savant for
    cruelty. The Warboss turned each siege into a game. Seeing what it would take to make each Stronghold crack. Unlike
    true humans, the Squats do not fall into despair or misery in hopeless situations. Instead they go mad with rage and
    grief. Becoming almost as brutal as the Orks themselves. Which was exactly what Grunhag wanted. Like a simple animal
    working to crack open a shelled meal. Grunhag would work to make each Stronghold break, and provide an excellent
    fight for the Greenskins.<br />
    <br />
    Squat sagas and ballads are glutted with accounts of Grunhags evil. Using captured children from fallen Strongholds
    as shields or entertainment in full view of Squat defenders. Carving a crude drawing of Gork or Mork onto a Moon
    with stolen Squat mining gear and then launching the moon to crash into the world below. So the occupying
    stronghold&apos;s last sight was the cruel grin of the Orkish gods leering down from the heavens. Other events were
    banal by Orkish standards. Like the flaying of Squat champions in front of surviving civilians. The tanned skin was
    then stitched onto Grunhags &#x201C;Big Banna.&#x201D; A thirty-meter tall flag composed of the skins of Grunhags
    kills and the origin of his epitaph. <br />
    <br />
    After the fall of the Great Stronghold of Maran-Duur the Squats reconvened the Council of the Khazkhun to plan new
    strategies against the Greentide. Against the ruling of some of the more conservative members a blanket distress
    call to any surviving allies from the rest of the Galaxy. Next, a series of blitz-attacks against the Warboss and
    his Nobs was planned. Hoping to eliminate Grunhag and drive the WAAAGH!!! Into chaos. While many of the Warbosses
    favored lieutenants met their fate fighting death-pact bound Squat Kill-Teams. Grunhag managed to survive every
    time. In a desperate measure, the Living Ancestors called a great Diaspora. The Squats would evacuate to the oldest
    and greatest Squat worlds. These ancient homes of the Khazkhun could withstand anything and hold nearly the entire
    Squat race if needed. They had been constantly expanded over thousands of years in the case of an event such as
    this.<br />
    <br />
    With great bitter grief Stronghold after Stronghold was emptied. With only the most aged and stubborn Squats staying
    behind. Ready to make the Orks pay for every inch of their ancestral halls. With the natural and automated defenses
    of each Stronghold remaining. The hope was each empty stronghold would tire out the Orks and bore them. Giving the
    Hold-Worlds of the Squats time to prepare for what was coming. <br />
    <br />
    Millions of Squats across hundreds of worlds fled to the Seven Hold-Worlds of the Squats. A heptarchy of close-knit
    worlds that traced their lineage back to the first colonists of the Galactic Core. Nearly a quarter of the Squat
    fleet was lost in the desperate battles to protect the refugees. The seven Hold-Worlds existed along a chain of
    systems near the galactic core. With a single stable Warp route connecting them all. The first of the Hold-Worlds
    was Linnar-Khaz. A fortress of uncomparable hardiness. Where the Squat Fleet and the forces of a thousand
    strongholds would break the Orkish hordes. <br />
    <br />
    It took the Orks centuries to smash their way through the abandoned holds. Increasing the petty rage of Grunhag with
    each empty fortress. Buying the Squats valuable time to fortify Linnar-Khaz. During the diaspora, the Squats had
    taken everything of value they could. Including weapons and Void-Ships devastating potency. The thousands of years
    and thousands of strongholds of Squats history came together to create a fortress that could even rival High Terra
    itself. <br />
    <br />
    When the first Ork ships exited the Warp they faced complete annihilation. Mined out Asteroid belts were turned into
    mazes of death. Where every rock could hold automated defenses or suicide charges. Floating cities designed for
    Gas-Giant mining were repurposed as colossal artillery platforms. Hiding in the thick atmosphere of Linnar Systems
    outer worlds, ready to unleash moonlet cracking firepower at a moment&apos;s notice. The Squats fleet patrolled the
    system, creating a system of moving kill-boxes. Great cryo-vaults were assembled upon Linnar-Khaz. Massive temporary
    tombs where millions could be kept in cryo-sleep, freeing up supplies for the siege. Great Brotherhoods of Squat
    Warriors marshaled. Throngs hundred thousand strong and eager to spill Orkish blood.<br />
    <br />
    At first Grunhag simply sent a steady stream of Orkish ships through the Warp route to Linnar-Khaz. When this did
    not work he started assembling fleets of his maddest Orks to use the uncharted warp to travel to Linnar-Khaz.
    Avoiding the defenses built around the Warp route by passing through the frenzied Warp currents that were beyond
    navigation. Grunhag thought to combine the sheer numbers of the Orkish fleets deployed and the psychic resonance of
    said fleets psychotic Orks. Making it somewhat likely a few of the fleets would survive the trip. The Warboss was
    correct, and the Squat fleets faced numerous inclusions across the System from insane Ork Ships. <br />
    <br />
    These strategies were proving too slow for Grunhag. Methodical and patient by any sentient standards, even he was
    growing bored of the siege. Having to continuously crush insurrections led by terrified Nobs. Fearing being fed into
    the meat grinder that was assaulting Linnar-Khaz might have also had something to do with it. Despite what the
    Squats and many of his fellow Orks believed. The Warboss was not sending millions of Orks to certain death for a
    cheap laugh. They were a distraction while his secret weapon was finished.<br />
    Grunhag had long dreamed of creating a tool of destruction so formidable and utterly mad it would force his rivals
    on Ullanor and Gorro to acknowledge him as an equal. For thousands of years, the Ork leader had designed his weapon
    in fever-dreams of Gork and Mork given inspiration. Now with the resources of the conquered Squat homeworlds and a
    veritable army of Mekboys in his thrall. Grunhag had all he needed. <br />
    <br />
    As the siege of Linnar-Khaz bore on for dozens of generations the Orcs of WAAAGH Grunhag worked on a mechanical
    monstrosity that could break the stalemate. In his lifetime of war and raiding, Grunhag had acquired a truly massive
    amount of loot from the countless planets he had methodically destroyed. The machines, ships, weapons, stations and
    general equipment of these worlds would form the core of this Orkish doomsday weapon. Like many Warbosses, Grunhag
    used a modified space-hulk as a Flagship of sorts. Now the Orkish Warboss intended to upgrade his vessel. For
    hundreds of years, swarms of Gretchins and Mekboys added onto the Space-Hulk. Bolting and attaching everything and
    anything that caught their beady eyes. Entire void-ships were peeled apart and added to the space-hulk. A dozen
    Squat mining orbitals were turned into a jury-rigged keel for the monstrosity. Asteroids were caught in huge nets
    and reeled in like schools of fish. The cosmic debris was mined of everything of value and lodged into the
    labyrinthine structure. Becoming additional segments of the ever-growing ship. A combined thruster system that when
    fully ignited was brighter than Sol itself was strapped to the Super-Hulk&apos;s back. Ramshackles cities of Orks
    sprung up across Grunhags magnum opus. Fleets of Orkish ships circled it like pilot-fish. One particularly insane
    Orkish Dok created legions of &#x201C;Killa-Kans&#x201D; to stalk the hulks&apos; surface as additional defenses.<br />
    <br />
    Scholars might be tempted to compare Grunhags monster to the Attack-Moons of the Beast Wars. This is not an accurate
    comparison. The &#x201C;Bigga Hulk&#x201D; as the Orks started to call Grunhags new vessel was not a modified
    planetoid, designed as both fortress and relay. This leviathan of a Space Hulk was quite simply the end stage of the
    evolution of such celestial trash-heaps. Nurtured and cultivated by the Greenskin tyrant much like he might a
    favored Squig. After nearly a thousand years of construction, the Bigga Hulk was considered finished by Grunhag. It
    measured more than half the size of Luna and looked like a comet of wreckage. With Grunhags personal symbol covering
    the front half of it. The effort to send the Bigga Hulk through the Warp caused nearby systems to be engulfed in
    Warp Storms. After hundreds of Weirdboyz reduced to pink-mist and many death threats directed at Grunhags Mek gang.
    The Bigga-Hulk careened into the Immaterial and rode the Warp-Rift towards its destiny. <br />
    <br />
    For the months it took to travel to Linnar System, the Hold-World was plagued by nightmares and strange psychic
    phenomena. The spiritual equivalent of the tide going out before a Tsunami. Then after weeks of apprehension, the
    Bigga Hulk arrived. Ripping into the material like the vomitus of an angry god. Its presence instantly affected the
    gravity of the system. Orkish grav-tech and its own bulk sending minor tremors across the Linnar-Khaz system. The
    Bigga Hulk did not so much destroy the first lines of the Squat defense, but literally crash into them. Entire Squat
    ships and Star-Forts crushed under the Orks flagship, their ruined frames adding to its armor of wrecks. <br />
    <br />
    Thankfully for the Squats, the effort of such an impact and the ensuing damage crippeled the Bigga Hulks thrusters.
    Reducing its momentum from the blazing fist of Gork and Mork to a glacial pace. The Khazkhun defenders reacted
    remarkably well and turned the entire force of the system&apos;s guns onto the Bigga Hulk. Which pummeled its shoddy
    shields and turned its surface to molten slag. Grunhag barely seemed to notice the Squat bombardment. He knew his
    masterpiece could survive it, and it would buy him time. Time for the rest of the Orkish fleet to arrive. With the
    defenses of Linnar focused on the scrap-behemoth. The main body of WAAAGH Grunhag entered the system. <br />
    <br />
    Realizing the threat the Squat defenders took a different strategy. The hidden orbital artillery platforms directed
    fire at the Bigga Hulks thrusters. Repurposed mining ships launched explosive-laden asteroids as the Orkish
    flagship. Cutting the Bigga Hulks momentum and directing its orbit through explosive impact. Allowing the main body
    of the Squat fleet and defenses to turn their attention towards the incoming Orkish fleet. This quickly became a
    costly mistake. The mass and momentum of the Bigga Hulk were not it&apos;s only threat. Hidden across its bizarre
    design were as many turrets and armaments as multiple Imperial Battlegroups. At Grunhags&apos;s signal of psychotic
    laughter, the Bigga Hulk opened fire. <br />
    <br />
    Filling the void with a literal cloud of munitions and energy bolts. Ordinance ranging from finger-sized to frigate
    sized exploded across the system. For fifteen solid Terran minutes, the Bigga Hulk poured its firepower into the
    Linnar system. Shredding hundreds of Squat vessels and thousands of unlucky Orkish ships. The Hulks guns aimed in
    literally every direction. Not caring what they hit, as long as they hit something. After this storm of
    &#x201C;Dakka&#x201D;, the Bigga Hulks bombardment was cut short thanks to the Orks themselves.<br />
    <br />
    The shear strain of the simultaneous weapon fire detonated five of the Bigga Hulks&apos; &#x201C;main&#x201D;
    reactors. Disemboweling the ship with a mixture of nuclear detonations and structural collapse Stripped of nearly
    all of its maneuvering ability and a decent chunk of its firepower. The Bigga Hulk became a new planet in the Linnar
    system. While crippeled it was still a ferocious beast. Grunhag seemed to decide to make do with his ruined ship.
    Thinking he could rebuild it even bigger and better with the loot from the Squat Hold-Worlds. <br />
    <br />
    With the remaining firepower of the Bigga Hulk, the Orks managed to take the outer reaches of the system. Yet the
    stalwart Squat defenders held the line and kept the inner system. With Linnar-Khaz acting as fortress and home for
    the Squats and the Bigga Hulk for the Orks. An impossible siege was underway. The Squats still held control of the
    Mandeville Point leading deeper into the Hold-Worlds. With a steady stream of resources and defenses coming through
    it to aid the Squats. Similarly, the carnage of the Siege called out across the galaxy and countless Orks would
    answer its call from the other Mandeville point.<br />
    <br />
    The stories and legends from the Siege of Linnar-Khaz could fill a hundred books. It lasted for thousands of years
    (Squat time of course) and is considered one of the greatest testaments of the will and fortitude one can find
    across mankind. Even in its abhuman members. The time between the first Orkish ship entering the Linnar System to
    the first living Ork touching the ground of Linnar-Khaz was over two thousand years. A feat of survival and
    fortification only matched by the Steel Wardens exploits at the galactic Hell-Mouths millennia later.<br />
    <br />
    The saga of this great siege might have lasted even longer than that. If not for a key event that spelled doom for
    the Squat Hold-Worlds. The arrival of an Eldar fleet. Materializing from seemingly nothing the Eldar weaved through
    the Orkish armada and Squat defenses. The incredible precision and skill of the Xenos on full display. When the news
    first reached Linnar-Khaz the eldest of the Living Ancestors are said to have shouted with joy. Long ago before the
    Ork Wars and during the Age of Silicon and the Squat Renaissance. The Aeldari Craftworlds had been counted as some
    of the closest trade partners and allies of the Squats. It was thought that the ancient oaths of aid signed long ago
    were being honored. The call for aid from millennia ago finally answered.<br />
    <br />
    Lean and beautiful, the Aeldari ships were not the cruel designs of the Dark Cities. These were indeed children of
    the Craftworlds. Yet they came for reasons of their own. Reaching orbit of Linnar-Khaz. The Eldar leader with little
    ceremony or decorum demanded something returned to her people. In ages long past the Craftworld Zandros had
    entrusted the Squats with a cache of gems for safekeeping. Psychic stones taken from the Temple of Isha and stored
    elsewhere. A memento of a fallen civilization, saved by the foresight of an ancient seer. Puzzled but happy to
    oblige the contract, the Squats still held the gems. Even during the diaspora, they refused to blemish their honor
    by failing their oath of stewardship. The Squats had one condition, however. Craftworld Zandros would honor its own
    pledges of aid in exchange for the gems. Those binding words were meant for the Squats&apos; darkest hour, and that
    was now.<br />
    <br />
    The unreadable Eldar leader simply cut communications. Her final words in the Aeldari lexicon. A phrase that could
    be translated in one of three ways. Apologizing for a failure, dismissing something unimportant, and strangely a
    promise of protection to an unborn child. Before the Squats could even attempt to hail the Eldar again. A force of
    Eldar warriors burst into the Elder-Hall of Linnar-Khaz. Leaping through a webway portal, a coven of garishly clad
    soldiers tore through the surprised Squat leaders. Unarmored and surprised, the elderly Khazkhun were cut down
    easily. Before the guards could react to the attack, the Eldar had cut pieces from the Councilmen and women and
    stolen their Oath-Keys. <br />
    <br />
    Like a gale of blades and blood, the Eldar fled through the heart of Linnar-Khaz. Evading the wrathful Squats and
    making their way to the Great Vaults of the Squat Clans. Using the flesh and keys of the High-Council the Eldar
    picked the locks. Retrieved the gems from the vault and fled back through the Hold-World. Losing a handful of their
    number to Hearthguard and other defenders. With the target of this raid secured the Eldar escaped through a Webway
    portal and onto their ships. The small Craftworld fleet spent this time strafing Linnar-Khaz and refusing the Squat
    hails, and demands for an explanation. Once the Eldar were safely on board the ships. The Xeno craft unleashed a
    volley of weapons across Linnar-Khaz and its defenses before escaping the system. <br />
    <br />
    The sudden death of the near entirety of the Squat High-Council sent shockwaves throughout the defenders. Living
    Ancestors of the first generations snuffed out. Clan leaders and revered elders cut down without explanation. Then
    the fleet attack across Linnar-Khaz had damaged key infrastructures and defenses. The strange alien weapons
    penetrated the fortifications easily and reaped a great toll. Just as the Squats started to recover, the true damage
    of the attack was revealed. The life support systems of millions of cryo-pods had been damaged. Leaving their
    occupants to die. The lucky ones simply froze solid, others woke up and suffocated or starved in chilled coffins.
    Entire clans were wiped out. Relatives and friends killed by the thousand.<br />
    <br />
    Shock and horror filled the hearts of every Squat. The pain and inconceivable loss burrowing into the Abhumans
    obsessive minds. Many went mad with grief. Some simply wasted away. Doing their duty for the Hold-World but refusing
    to eat. The steel-hard spirit of the Squats had been cracked. A crack the Orks took great advantage of. <br />
    <br />
    As the full effects of the atrocity wounded Linnar-Khaz the Orks prepared a great offensive. The Bigga Hulk had been
    somewhat repaired. With Grunhag at the helm of the mighty vessel. Eager to finally break open Linnar-Khaz. As the
    Orks closed in on the Squat world they faced a new challenge. The grief of the Khazkhun became unbridled wrath.
    Maddened with pain and fury the Squat defenders became the attackers. Throwing everything they had at the Orks in a
    violent act of ritual suicide. More than half the population of Linnar-Khaz was clutched by this Oath-rage. Ready to
    die and kill as many enemies as they could in the process. The Orks loved it. This was the payoff they had been
    promised. A final good and proper fight for the ages.<br />
    <br />
    The other half of the defenders who retained their sanity prepared to evacuate. Leaving Linnar-Khaz and joining the
    other Hold-Worlds. Helping them survive and defend themselves. The Oath-Rager Squats were happy to die defending the
    evacuation. Letting those who wished to survive fight another day. Even mad with grief and less than half their
    original number the Squats of Linnar-Khaz fought on. Delaying the Orks for centuries. Dying to the last in combat
    with the Greentide. With oaths of vengeance upon their lips and Greenskin blood soaked into their beards.<br />
    <br />
    At last the Orks moved on from Linnar-Khaz. While some stayed behind to loot and pillage. Grunhag pushed them
    forward. Eager to break the next Hold-World. They did not have to take long. The losses during the siege of
    Linnar-Khaz were irreplaceable. The damage done by the Orks and Eldar weakened the surviving Hold-Worlds. Steadily
    the Orks broke each one. Working there way down the chain of stars. Almost leisurely enjoying the death and carnage
    they caused. By one and a half thousand years after the fall of Linnar-Khaz, all the Hold-Worlds had fallen. All
    except one.
