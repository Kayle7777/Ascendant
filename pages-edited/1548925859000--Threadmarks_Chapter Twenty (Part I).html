        <b>Chapter Twenty: The Lunar Crusade</b></span><br>
    <br>
    Location: The Tri-Legion Fleet in Luna Orbit<br>
    Date: 813.M30 ( Nine hours since the battle for Luna beguin)<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    The XI, XIII and XVI Legions had smashed through the pseudo-blockade of Chaos vessels and charged to Luna. The VII
    Legion had helped them punch through the enemy fleet, and were now busy keeping it from attacking the three legions
    rear and defending Terran Void-space. Safe from tainted raiders. Luckily for the Imperial Invaders, the civil war
    within the Moon prevented any meaningful orbital defense. Once separated from the Chaos Hordes the full might of
    three Astartes Legions could be easily unleashed upon the traitors.<br>
    <br>
    While they had directed their fleet, the Primarchs telepathically communicated in order to create a strategy. The
    psionic-link connecting their souls did not simply protect them from Chaos, but allowed the Brothers to mentally
    communicate over vast distances easily. A powerful boon in Void-Warfare.<br>
    <br>
    Each Legion would play to their speciality in the battle. The XIII would form the main bulk of the offence, their
    numbers and tactical flexibility would allow them to wage war across the entire Moon. This offense would be
    complimented by XI Legion strike forces inserted into the XIII battle lines, providing the main force a powerful
    sword and shield against Maleficarum. Horus had subdivided his legion for two similar roles. Half would deep strike
    into loyalist held territory and assist the defenders until the main force arrived, then add their numbers to the
    pacification. The other half would engage in decapitation strike against the Enemy leadership, splitting off from
    each other the Legion vessels entered orbit all across the Moon. Lacking any atmosphere to speak of, the Ships could
    safely anchor only a few kilometers above the Lunar surface. By now, a few Cultists had managed to scramble together
    Void-Defenses. Opening fire with powerful batteries, and even launching into Space within stolen imperial
    transports. They barely had time to launch the first volleys before their doom arrived.<br>
    <br>
    As one the three fleets opened fire upon the Lunar surface, Kinetic and Energy projectiles obliterated weapon
    emplacements. The stolen transports barely left Lunar ground before shot-cannon blasts of Flak pulped both them and
    their occupants. This thunderous display of firepower was a small percentage of the Fleets destructive potential.
    They wanted Luna intact once the battle was over after all. So the second barrage was of a far more precise and
    deadly variety.<br>
    <br>
    Almost a million Astartes rained down upon Luna. The combined might of three Astartes Legions arrived in a rain of
    fire and iron. Drop Pods and Stormbirds descended in wave after wave of Imperial Fury. The sheer number and
    intensity of the Assault was not strictly necessary, yet the images recorded by lunar loyalists and fleet
    remembrancer would echo for generations. Propaganda can be as effective as bolter or blade if used correctly.<br>
    <br>
    Among the Stormbirds was a unique vessel. A custom made stead for a demigod. The Quadriga-Maxius was the personal
    Dropship of Marcus Augustio: The XIII Primarch. Backed by his Praetor Guards and Four Hundred Thousand Astartes, he
    marched to War. Arriving at the gates of Port Luna the XIII Legion had come and nothing could stop them.<br>
    <br>
    The first goal of the Lunar offense was taking control of Port Luna. The massive naval base took up most of Kepler
    Crater. If conquered the Rebels would lose total Void control. The Docks and fortifications would provide the
    Loyalists the ultimate beachhead if they could take it. Under normal circumstances the idea of sieging something
    like Port Luna would be an absurd idea. These were not normal circumstances. Demi-Gods clothed in transhuman flesh
    battled the forces of insanity.<br>
    <br>
    The XIII Legion stood before the Gates. Thousands of Astartes and accompanying vehicles stood ready for the order to
    attack. Their sinister equivalents stood atop the Ports battlements and Fort-Spires. Legions of Flesh-Beasts,
    Daemonhosts and Lunar Cultists baying for blood. The maddest and most violent warriors of Luna had been sent to the
    Port. The elite of the Four Phases had expected the Assault and herded their most vicious members here. The turrets
    and fortifications would exhaust the Emperors thralls. Then once they broke into the fortress the feral Chaos hordes
    contained within would butcher them.<br>
    <br>
    It was a simple but effective strategy that relied on two factors: The durability of Port Luna&#x2019;s defenses,
    and a powerful Champion of the Gods. The Champion would through fear, fury and charisma keep the feral servants from
    diving into the battle to early. Some of the more vicious and insane Chaos-Berserkers would have happily dived off
    the mountain sized battlements, chasing foul glory.<br>
    <br>
    The Champion selected for this honor stood above the massive gate. Peering down at the invaders like so many
    Warlords and Tyrant-Kings before him. He was a Daemon Prince of power and pedigree. Known to his foes and allies as
    Zaubernox. Chosen of all Four Gods of the Warp. He had ended his entire species to walk the path of glory. Summoned
    forth into the body of an eager servant he had corralled the chaos hordes and was eager to test his mettle against
    the Primarch.<br>
    <br>
    Unfortunately for Zaubernox the Demigod he faced was not one for glorious duels. Marcus Augistio was a practical man
    who understood that a siege would be costly. While he was confident the Daemon Prince would fall to his
    Power-Gladius, he felt it was unnecessary and a waste of precious time and resources. So, when the Warp-traitor
    howled psychic challenge and curses down from the battlements, he simply contacted his flagship. After a few moments
    of calculation and assessment he settled on a course of action.<br>
    <br>
    Horus and his Legion teleported deep into Luna and was rapidly drawing much of the defenders attention. XI Legion
    pilots from their Eighth Formation were busy distracting the orbital and anti-void defenses so the rest of their
    Legion could make their move. This gave Marcus an opportunity to complete his objective efficiently. Arrangements
    were made and he approached the Super-Titan sized gate. Neither side opened fire as the Primarch raised his hands
    and mustered his psychic power. Being an average Psyker among the Primarchs, he knew what he was about to do would
    be rather draining. Ironically, the thinning of realspace allowed him to draw additional power from the Warp.
    Further proving his father&apos;s teachings that the Warp belonged to mankind, not the False-Gods.<br>
    <br>
    Glancing up to Zaubernox Marcus responded to the Daemon Prince for the first time. &#x201C;The Gate can be
    Replaced&#x201D;<br>
    <br>
    Before the infernal lord upon the battlements could understand the messages meaning, his doom struck. A single Lunar
    Class Cruiser of the XIII Legion fleet had positioned itself above Port Luna&#x2019;s main gate. It fired a
    super-charged Lance Beam upon the Gate. In the exact moment it struck, the XIII Primarch used his incredible power
    to evaporate the Void-Shield protecting the Gate. Like the wrath of the Emperor himself, the Lance beam seared the
    Gate into nothingness. Its metal and stone structure became ash, then atoms. Zaubernox was cast screaming back into
    the Warp before he could even register what happened. Where once a mighty Bastion-gate stood was now an dusty
    crater.<br>
    <br>
    Panic, confusion and blood-rage filled the minds of the Ports defenders. Their master was gone in a blast of searing
    fire. Where once the gate stood was now a pillar of lunar dust. They had little time to gather themselves when
    judgement arrived. Through the rapidly cooling breach the XIII Legion charged. With their Primarch at their head
    they were unstoppable. They flooded into Port-Luna in a tide of blue armor. A that fought with transhuman
    efficiency. The chaos defenders were smashed apart with ruthless precision.<br>
    <br>
    Gene-Bulked beings that had once being kin to Ogryns leapt at the Thirteenth Legion&#x2019;s phalanxes and were cut
    down by bolter fire. Swarms of cultists in stolen void-suits were eviscerated beams of volkite energy and some met
    their fate when they were sucked into the freezing, unforgiving void. Factory farmed Chaos Spawn mobbed Mech-Suit
    wearing Astartes and were pummeled by thunder hammers. At every turn the XIII Legion smashed aside the corrupted
    defenders.<br>
    <br>
    Even through the dust filled chaos that was becoming the battle of the Gate Marcus Augistio noticed a peculiar
    pattern. A scant number of enemy combatants were scurrying from the fight. This was not outside the
    Primarch&#x2019;s theoreticals. Servants of Chaos were cowardly by nature. What worried the Primarch were the
    pattern of mutation and markings the cowards shared. Even while dueling multiple Flesh-golems simultaneously, Marcus
    assessed the situation and realized what was about to occur. The runaways were Tzeentch Cultists preparing a
    ritual.<br>
    <br>
    This suspicion was quickly confirmed as the Primarch felt a swelling of dark power. 99 Sorcerers all around the
    battlefield that was once the Ports antichamber and gate were calling upon their patrons might. Marcus did not know
    what hex they intended to cast and did not care to find out. His sons had been selected for this duty thanks to
    their purity and numbers. Even so they had suffered from the Chaotic attack and were fighting at sub-standard
    levels. Marcus was not going to risk his gene-sons or victory. The Sorcerers must be stopped.<br>
    <br>
    Kalib and his Legion had not arrived yet and the XIII Librarius could not handle what was coming. This left Marcus
    with a singular option. He was loathe to enact his trump card this early in the battle, but it was the most
    practical option. Sending a telepathic warning to all allied Psykers he prepared to use The Hand of Dominion.<br>
    <br>
    Executing the golems with efficient thrusts of his Gladius Marcus gained a scant amount of precious breathing room
    and lifted his free hand up into the air. The power-fist encased hand spread its fingers and he brought it down onto
    the cracked stone of Luna, like he was swatting an annoying insect. As he did this the Primarchs psychic power
    rippled out from him. Forming a massive field of warp-energy that extended kilometers in diameter. It was not
    noticed at first, for its nature was not of the kind many know exist. Instead of twisting the rules of the material
    or ripping open the veil it strengthened the barrier between material and immaterial.<br>
    <br>
    Marcus&#x2019;s Hand of Dominion nullified or weakened all but the mightiest psychic power within its radius. As a
    youth the Primarch had found Warp-craft messy and unpredictable. It was not reliable or efficient enough for his
    taste. After an encounter with a Blank in Malcador&#x2019;s employ an idea struck the young demigod. If psykers use
    their emotions and willpower to harness warp-energy to bend reality, could it also be used to enforce reality?
    Consulting with his father provided the information needed and Marcus Augisto set to work enforcing sanity upon the
    universe. His brother Tengri Khagan once remarked to Marcus &#x201C;I guess you are obsessive for all rules, even
    cosmic ones.&#x201D;<br>
    <br>
    Tengri did not know the half of it. Marcus had witnessed the horrors of the warp even from a young age. He had seen
    what the monsters hiding in the immaterium had done to his brother Konrad. Watching a friend and a brother who
    similar to him slowly go mad and almost be damned had a major effect on the young Marcus. Law, justice and unity
    kept mankind from becoming playthings for the false-gods. It was only logical for Marcus to apply his mental skill
    set to his psychic one. Enforcing righteous order upon a chaotic universe.<br>
    <br>
    Once enveloped in the Hand of Dominion, the Tzeentch Cultists found their ritual rapidly collapsing. Like an inferno
    starving for oxygen the dark power sputtered and died. Confusion filled the Dark-Sorcerers hearts. They only had
    moments to savor the emotion before the second wave of the Imperial assault arrived.<br>
    <br>
    From the void the XI Legion arrived. Not in drop pods but through gravity. They had jumped from their vessels and
    drop-ships into Luna&#x2019;s skies. The Eight Formation assault on Lunar void space was to distract the Cultists
    from this Assault. Like a gentle snowfall of Ceramite they had arrived all across Port Luna. This process took
    longer than the bombastic arrival of the XIII Legion but started at the same time.<br>
    <br>
    With the attention of the Port Luna defenders on the massive army marshaling at their front gate. It was rather easy
    for the XI Legion to burrow into the massive fortress and conquer it piece by piece. By the time the XIII Legion had
    entered the Port and Marcus used the Hand of Dominion the majority of important systems within Port Luna were under
    Imperial Control.<br>
    <br>
    Kalib Kraad the XI Primarch had lead this phantom-blitz himself. Using his own psionic abilities to muffle any
    psychic or material distress calls. The traitors and Daemons were locked in their fortress with a being designed to
    be their ultimate foe. Kalib lived up to this. He was a storm of blades, psychic fire and vicious instinct.
    Zaubervox was not the only Daemon Prince within Port Luna. The other one was considerably less lucky than him. Where
    Zaubervox was cast back into the warp and soundly humiliated, the other was not so lucky.<br>
    <br>
    Kalib had impaled the Tzeentch-Slave on a spire of Iron. Before vivisecting it spiritually. Peeling away layers of
    corruption and dark magic to find the last bits of mortal within the Daemon Prince. Kalib Kraad allowed himself a
    vicious grin as the creature&#x2019;s tiny shred of soul was plucked from its Daemonic self and locked away. Adding
    to his growing collection of damned souls. The husk of warp-energy that had once been a Mortal bound to Tzeentch was
    then burned away with silver fire. True Death was merciful compared to what was in store for this fallen Daemon
    Prince. Cut off from his patron god its identity and name were erased. The remnant of this once proud
    &#x201C;ascendant&#x201D; champion of chaos was now locked away within the the XI Primarchs gift from the
    Emperor.<br>
    <br>
    An obsidian cube, carved with countless glyphs of sealing and protection on even the microscopic level. This
    &#x201C;Rubi-Carceron&#x201D; as Kalib&#x2019;s father called it was an ancient relic that in his hands could
    imprison souls, Daemons, and worse. The lost Daemon Prince would spend the rest of time within the cube. If Kalib
    did not find a use for the soul scrap as test subject or ritual fodder.<br>
    <br>
    So when the XIII Legion pushed the Chaos berserkers and fanatics back to the Ports interior they did not find allies
    and security but another force of Astartes. Then as a final nail in the cultists resistance another mass of XI
    Legion warriors arrived from the void. Surrounded by Transhuman warriors and neutered of their dark blessings and
    stolen fortress-port the defenders of Port Luna were exterminated.<br>
    <br>
    With the beachhead claimed, Imperial Auxilia could be ferried to the surface. They would support and hold the
    territory claimed by the Imperial offense. Regrouping the XI and XIII Legion prepared to set out. The Lunar Crusade
    would purge any and all remnants of Chaos from Sol. Spreading out the twin Legions formed up into multiple hundred
    thousand strong armies to march across and within Luna. Nothing would or could stop this. With the number and
    adaptiveness of the XIII, supported by the XI&#x2019;s viciousness and psionic expertise, the Creed of the Four
    Phases was doomed. Even so their foul patrons had a few other strings to pull. Fate is a funny thing and some
    puppets of the Dark Gods are doomed to dance to a familiar tune no matter what. Even if death had already claimed
    them.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Location: Hazardous Specimen Storage Alpha, Mare Ingenii.<br>
    Date: 813.M30 (Shortly after the murder of Zamora and unleashing of Chaos)<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    The walls of existence became dangerously thin throughout Luna. Warp Energy crackled and roiled through the natural
    satellite. Rifts were constantly splitting open. Leaking Daemons and lesser warp-vermin into the tunnels that criss
    crossed Luna. Blasphemous rituals and dark wards protected them from most of the Astronomicon&#x2019;s light.
    Creating a domain of shadows and corruption. Here, the elite of the Lunar Cult drank deep the power of the Warp.
    Growing swollen with the Gods favor, and becoming ever madder.<br>
    <br>
    The beings that had once been the Creed of the Four Phases would have been horrified and disgusted by what had
    become of them and Sacred Luna. Now they revelled in damnation. Protected from sanity and decency by the first boon
    of Chaos. All who walk the path of glory are slowly stripped of what is Anathema to Chaos: control. They became
    literal lunatics, seeking greater and greater heights of insanity to earn the Gods favor. An eternal cycle of
    self-destruction that fed the Gods and let them affect the Materium.<br>
    <br>
    This feeding frenzy of Chaos attracted the attention of countless Daemons. All seeking to enter the warp-soaked
    materium of Luna through the various gateways created by the cults. The warps power was becoming a part of Luna and
    if the gods had their way it would join the celestial family of Daemon Worlds. Teetering on the edge of material and
    immaterial Luna could host some of the elder fiends of the Warp. One of these ancients of cursed Pedigree slithered
    through Luna on the hunt for an old friend. This Daemon took the form of a crow, or rather the idea of something a
    crow symbolizes. It had once been bound to a true-son of the Anathema. A wise Sorcerer who bound 72 Daemons to him
    in ancient times.<br>
    <br>
    Now it scutteled/flew/swam towards a hidden Vault within Luna. A place where the most dangerous artifacts and
    specimens on Luna were stored. This facility was were the Imperium dissected creatures and horrors it encountered.
    Most of these specimens had been slowly siphoned to the growing Imperial Palace. Where they met their fate in the
    Emperor&apos;s lab or the Dark Cells. Only a few items remained, those the most difficult to transport. Zamora the
    Squat had actually been sent on a mission to retrieve them when the Creed of the Four Phases had ambushed him.<br>
    <br>
    The most important of these artifacts was the Daemon&#x2019;s goal. The corpse of an impossible man. A captain in a
    Legion that did not exist, sent on a mission by a fallen Primarch. Along with his brothers he had been dissected and
    analysed by the Anathema himself. Improvements to the Astartes and their equipment could be traced to this. Now the
    Daemon mortals called Raum opened up the stasis coffin holding the body and poured himself into the desiccated
    flesh.<br>
    <br>
    The dark energy that filled Luna provided the power needed to knit the broken body back together. Armor plates were
    welded to rapidly mutating skin. Bolt-wounds were repaired and infused with putrid muscle. Neurons were rewired and
    pieces of a long lost soul were plucked from the warp by Raum. Its once and future symbiotic nature with the lost
    soul allowing this act. Then with a howl of dark Laughter the thirsting gods breathed life into a fallen servant
    to-be. The revenant Astartes lurched back into life as its Daemon ally welcomed him back to the land of the living:
    &#x201C;Hello Argel Tal.&#x201D;<br>
