    Plugging away with stuff, had a minor accident a few days ago that put me out of writing shape for a bit. (Nothing
    serious just needed to heal) <br>
    <br>
    The Terran Marines are indeed going to be involved with the story. The Legions will be a bit different than standard
    when it comes to tactics and Legion Culture. They will have similarities due to the Primarchs Genetics, Big-E&apos;s
    plans and some of the canon Primarch Homeworlds will become recruitment worlds. <br>
    <br>
    Also, my plans for the story after Chapter Nine is either going to be the next part of the Primarch Results or
    Chapter Ten which will open up the next part Arc. It will be primarily the Conquest of the Solar System, the
    formations of the Legions, and the youth of the Primarchs.
