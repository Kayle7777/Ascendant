                It amazes me at how you have this incredibly detailed plan that has layers upon layers of complexity. I
                remember someone a while ago mentioned how you took the name Kaleb Kraad from some guy in Warhammer
                Fantasy named Kaleb Daark. How in the world do you have this much knowledge and how do you keep it all
                straight?!

    From a young age I have always enjoyed delving into information and absorbing as many facts and concepts as I could.
    Warhammer 40k is the most recent of these special interests and it has truly caught my attention. So I worked to
    learn everything possible about the franchise. After about a year or two of this, I decided to try my handwriting.
    My first attempts were nothing to write home about but I steadily improved. Crafting universes, saga&apos;s and
    concepts brings me joy and I use a system of &quot;internal writing&quot; and a few notes to keep it all straight.
    Basically, I mentally write out the story and take notes on what works and what does not. I am really enjoying
    writing this story and actually just got myself a Patreon (<a href="https://www.patreon.com/Jayfiction99" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow noopener">Jayfiction is creating Writing Stories | Patreon</a>) to help support myself. Recording my creative process is actually something I am working on with the Patreon.
    I&apos;ve got big plans for this universe and I hope the quality only improves from here.
