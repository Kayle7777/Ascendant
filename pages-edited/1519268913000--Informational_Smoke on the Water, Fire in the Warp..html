            <br>
            Imagine you are a Leviathan, a lord of the Deep that can summon hurricanes with a breath. You reach out of
            the sea and drag your prey into the depths for your own amusement. You and your siblings are the undisputed
            masters of your domain, every being in the depths serves you or fears you. Yet you hunger for more, to drag
            all that lies in the light into the depths, to reach out from beneath the waves and pull the continents into
            the sea.<br>
            <br>
            Now imagine there is a hunter, a brave surface dweller who can travel the depths unmolested and seeks to
            slay each of you. No matter what you try, you can not destroy him, he is beyond your reach and worse still
            he has a plan. A plan to starve you till you waste away, till your once great form is rotten and skeletal,
            till you are weak and broken. Then he will poison the ocean, make it so what had once been your domain is
            now anathema to your very being. You, your siblings and your spawn will die slow horrible deaths as the
            Hunters own children take to the poisoned sea now that it is safe from your hunger.<br>
            <br>
            Yet you and your siblings have a plan, a plan to stop the Hunter and use his own might against him. You plot
            to steal his young and twist them to your will. Force him to raise vipers in his nest, half of them will
            fall and drag there father into the depths with them. If you succeed not only will the hunter be broken
            utterly, turned into a living ever-screaming corpse but his greatest works will chum the waters and feed you
            well until you are strong enough to pull the world into the sea, where it will be yours to feed upon and
            play with for all eternity.<br>
            <br>
            The Plan is working, the bait has been laid and the Hunters Spawn are almost in your embrace, then suddenly
            everything is burning, your minions are ripped apart by the ghosts of broken tools and the spawn are safe.
            Before you can even realize what has occurred and start to plan something new the Ocean is alight. The
            surface of the sea is burning, the Hunter has somehow become something greater. No longer a monster-slayer
            but a Lord of the Surface and the Skies. He lets just a small trickle of his blood fall into the sea and the
            surface is ablaze. No matter how much you rage, the storms you seek to make are burned upon the surface.
            Each foray above the waves becomes a painful race against time for leaving the safety of the depths exposes
            you to scorching flames. Flames fed by all those you sought to feed off and play with.<br>
            <br>
            You realize your great scheme has failed, the Hunter and his spawn are coming. You once master of the depths
            now know something new, what its like to be preyed upon, what its like to be the victim of something beyond
            your imagination, to reap a terrible reward for misguided greedy actions. In short, the suffering you have
            long inflicted upon the Hunters people is now yours.<br>
