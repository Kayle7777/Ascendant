    <b><i>Book II: The Great Crusade</i><br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Chapter Twenty-Three: On Silver Wings</b></b><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <i><u>Location: The Seraphim, flagship to the IX Legion - In orbit of Vostroya.<br>
            Date: 890.M30 (One Solar Week before the assault on Hossak)</u></i><br>
    <br>
    The IX Crusader Fleet left Vostroya with as much data as the Imperium could squeeze from the ghost fleet. All added
    to the rapidly growing Lexancium archive. Vostroya also had another gift for the IX Legion as they prepared to
    leave. The industrial world provided fifty Auxilia Cohorts to join the IX Crusader Fleet. Each cohort was composed
    of 120,000 trained soldiers and equipped with the best weapons and supplies Vostroya had, swelling the Imperial
    Fleet by six and a half million. <br>
    <br>
    Dante noted with a grim acceptance that these numbers would be needed in the coming battles. The shifting tides of
    fate obstructed his foresight, but not enough to blind him of the huge amount of death to come. The future seethed
    with inevitable carnage. Data gained from the Mechancium analysis of the ghost fleet indicated the nature of the
    threat and the fleet&apos;s system of origin. A Xeno-Horribilis known as The Khrave were to blame. These nocturnal
    mind-eaters had been encountered before, yet never with power or numbers to conquer an urban world capable of
    warp-travel. They had mainly been wandering predators, picking off weak worlds or populations similar to how the
    Eldar hunted. Analyzing the data, Dante felt his father&apos;s cryptic words echo through his mind. &#x201C;We will
    face three great threats in the Great Crusade. The taint of Chaos, the Greenskin hordes and festering horror of the
    Rangda Cerebvore along with their spawn.&#x201D; <br>
    <br>
    Much like Dante, the Emperor&apos;s psychic foresight was diminished by the sheer complexity and variability of
    multiple, simultaneous, galaxy-wide wars. The Master of Mankind had done his best to warn his sons but trusted them
    to use their own judgment. Malleable visions of possible futures would do more to harm than help. Still, foresight
    was useful in both immediate and especially for long term use, where the trends of destiny were more set. Foresight
    had become a valuable tool of the IX legion, its Primarch forming a pact of students both Human and Astartes to
    assist him. This Grigori Choir as it became known was composed of Librarians and sanctioned Psykers who worked
    together to enhance the potency and accuracy of Dante&apos;s visions. <br>
    <br>
    The Choir had storied history and showed its worth yet again as the IX Prepared to journey to the Khrave infested
    system. In the great resonant amphitheater at the heart of the Sephirah, the flagship of the IX Legion, hundreds of
    psykers stood in attendance arranged into choruses of one librarian aided by nine psykers. The Grigori prepared to
    work as Dante stood in the center of the amphitheater, acting as the focal point of the ritual. Clothed in white
    robes, the Primarch flared his wings out and started to chant. At this signal, his sons and students joined him.
    Inhumanly beautiful voices harmonized in a meditative song. As the Archangel, angels and anointed humans sang their
    minds drifted into the immaterial. Just as their voices added to each other in the material, their minds worked
    together to peer into the future. <br>
    <br>
    This choir of angels and angel-touched added their power to the gilded inferno that was the IX Primarch, allowing
    the superhuman intellect of Dante to pluck details and information from a thousand possible futures. Dante&#x2019;s
    goal wasn&#x2019;t to predict or change the future. Instead, he sought to gather as much tactical data as possible.
    If in a hundred futures, an enemy fleet opened fire upon the IX Legion, Dante had a hundred visions to learn the
    formation and tactics of the enemy. <br>
    <br>
    Learning all he could, Dante started to feel the strain of this task upon his choir. They would be needed in the
    battles to come. With a soothing whisper to their souls, the Primarch guided the Grigori to end the ritual. It was
    no easy thing to touch a Primarch&#x2019;s soul, even with his consent and guidance. As was their tradition, the
    psykers each grasped the metal wings of their overseeing Astartes who in turn formed a chain of hands around the
    room, connecting all the Librarians, and ending the chain at the two Coryphaeus Librarians. In turn, the two leaders
    of the left and right side of the choir touched the Primarchs wings to form a great chain through which thoughts and
    memories could pass, feeding into the Primarch&#x2019;s mind and expanding his view of events past his own
    interpretation and perspective. <br>
    <br>
    Ending this process by folding his wings, the Primarch bowed to the Grigori and offered words of appreciation and
    kindness. Leaving the Choir to recover from the ordeal, Dante left to consult with his officers. Within the
    strategy-deck of the Seraphim, Dante met with the four battle masters of his Legion, known as the Hayyoth. These
    Astartes were personally selected as his closest subordinates after a grueling vetting process, and each was a
    master of a distinct breed of warfare. First was Raldoron-bin-Vir, master of the Legion&#x2019;s elites. The second
    was Asmodei-bin-Tauri, master of the Legion&#x2019;s armor-skeletons. The third was Sahaqi-bin-Avis, master of the
    Legion&#x2019;s winged and mounted warriors. The fourth was Verchiel-bin-Leo, master of the Legion&#x2019;s warriors
    of the blade and claw. Fifth in attendance was not a member of the Hayyoth brotherhood of generals.
    Azkaellon-bin-Vigil, the leader of the Ophanim. The Primarch&#x2019;s own guards stood in the shadow of his
    gene-fathers wings. <br>
    <br>
    The five Astartes saluted their Primarch and sat at the grand holo table in the room&#x2019;s center. Each of the
    Astartes was proud noble warriors, but they were nothing compared to the radiant splendor of their gene-father. Even
    after over a century of close exposure and companionship, the warriors of the IX&#x2019;s inner circle were
    awestruck by Dante&#x2019;s aura. The Primarch was an Angel given flesh and struck awe and devotion into the hearts
    of mankind. <br>
    <br>
    Each of the chosen Astartes felt a sense of pride that they had been trusted by their Primarch to be his closest
    advisors. They, who were tasked to hear of his visions first, tasked with helping Dante share his prophetic burden.
    Knowledge of these visions and seats at the Holo-Table would soon be expanded to the Lord-Commanders, Chapter
    Masters and other elite of the Legion. The nature of the Primarch&#x2019;s visions sometimes required only his most
    trusted sons to learn the full truth. Mortal and Astartes alike seeking to alter the future could easily become
    sources of calamity. It took a skilled hand and deft intellect to weave new futures. Knowledge alone of possible
    futures without the ability to handle that information had spelled the doom of countless seers across species and
    millennia. Dante sought to prevent that fate befalling himself or his sons.<br>
    <br>
    With a gesture, Dante produced a psychic illusion of the world they sought. A projection of information compiled
    from countless visions turned into a military briefing by a demigod&#x2019;s mind. Combining words and psychic
    messages the Primarch spoke. &#x201C;The Ghost Fleet&#x2019;s origin is a civilized world called Hossak of the
    Hossak system. It is less than a week of Warp-Travel away and will be relatively easy to navigate too. The scar upon
    the Warp left by the Ghost fleets final voyage is still visible to Navigators and me. The Hossak system is under the
    control of the Xeno species known as the Khrave. They are mind-eaters. Some of my brothers and the Expedition Fleets
    have encountered them before.&#x201D; <br>
    <br>
    Dante pulled up a flurry of images pulled from the Imperial Lexicanum and his visions. Depicting the Khrave and all
    their depravity. &#x201C;The actual Khrave are a species of parasitic worm. They capture other sentient species and
    consume their neural tissue and psychic activity through an unknown process. Horrifically, they also use bodies of
    sentient species found acceptable as hosts.&#x201D; The displayed data cut to a helm-recording of a VI Legion
    Astartes ripping the limbs of a horrific hunched over bat-like Xeno. The Astartes paused for a moment and let out a
    primal roar before plunging an armored fist into Xenos&apos;s chest and ripping a wriggling white worm free of its
    husk.<br>
    <br>
    Returning the images to projections of the Hossak system the Primarch continued: &#x201C;My visions and psychic
    senses indicate the Khrave are using Hossak as a farm of sorts. They are using the local humans as some sort of
    livestock, keeping part of the population as hosts and enforcers, while the rest are herded into concentration
    camps. We will face a combination of modified STC equipment used by the indigenous humans and more exotic Xeno
    weapons. Tyric and his sons reported the Khrave using psychic weaponry that turns warp-energy into blades and
    bolts.&#x201D; <br>
    <br>
    Taking a deep breath Dante let the image fade and spoke somberly: &#x201C;My sons, I fear this coming battle. Not
    because what we will face or what must be done to the lost and damned humans upon Hossak. I fear it for what it will
    ignite. We will win this battle, from a logistical, tactical, and strategic perspective, the Khrave lack the
    resources to stop the might of an Imperial Legion. There was not a single future where I saw us take substantial
    losses or damage of any kind. What happens after this battle is what disturbs me.&#x201D; <br>
    The golden light that accompanied the Primarch seemed to dim. The Archangel of Mankind feeling the weight of his
    burden. &#x201C;My sons, we have fought for decades to ensure the survival of mankind. Faced horrors and evils
    beyond count. Bringing judgment to all through blade and flame. Our liberation of Hossak will set forth a chain of
    events that will start a conflict beyond anything any of us have seen. Beyond anything, any living being aside from
    my Father and his contemporaries have witnessed. Mankind seeks to claim this galaxy as our domain. We are not the
    only ones. My visions have seen our foe. Xeno&#x2019;s capable of evil and destruction comparable only to the Orks
    and Chaos dwell in the galactic north. A festering empire that conquerors and kills in the cruelest manners
    possible. The Khrave are but a vassal and a tool to this enemy. Until now, the Imperium and this enemy have not come
    in contact. By striking the Khrave, we will start a war that will threaten mankind and the entire galaxy.&#x201D;
    <br>
    <br>
    &#x201C;The Rangda await us, they will unleash bio-terrors and war-breeds upon mankind. They will make no
    distinction between civilians or soldiers. We will suffer horribly in this endeavor. The Rangda will corrupt entire
    worlds with their gene-plagues, forcing us to butcher innocent humans by the billions. We were made to protect and
    help mankind. The coming war will make us defile that oath in order to fulfill it. My sons, I have seen the
    atrocities that must be done. Cities of millions burned with phosphex for fear of a single infected. Seven Legions,
    including us, will suffer greatly in the coming Xenocides. All of this will be- no, must be started when we bring
    death to the Khrave upon Hossak.&#x201D; <br>
    <br>
    Pausing for a moment, letting the impact of his words fall like hammer blows upon his chosen advisors, Dante slowly
    stood up from his throne at the head of the holotable and spread his wings. &#x201C;Raldoron, Asmodei, Sahaqi,
    Verchiel, Azkaellon, my loyal sons. I tell you this not to dishearten or dismay. We are the Angels of Death. Our
    Legion perhaps more than any other is worthy of that title. My father created us to do what must be done in the
    service of mankind. The trials before us will be great. The consequences for failure is the death of our species. In
    the times to come the Imperium will need us more than ever. The IX Legion will be Angels of Death. Just as we were
    always meant to be. War against the Rangda will test us, and I trust you all to do your duty. Telling you all these
    dire visions is meant to help you steel your souls and help me guide the IX Legion. We will start this war with a
    full understanding of what it entails. That does not just mean the destruction that will come from it. When we bring
    steel rain to Hossak and a thousand more worlds touched by the Rangda, we will save lives and end suffering. In the
    ancient texts of Terran cults, the Angel of Death was not always a figure of destruction. It was sometimes a figure
    of mercy and protection. The IX Legion will fly upon Silver Wings where even Daemons fear to tread. We will do so
    with righteous fury and just mercy. We will do this not just because our Emperor commands it, nor our Imperial Truth
    demands it. We will fight because it is what is right. There are people we can save and monsters we can slay. I will
    spread my wings and shed my blood to save all I can, I ask you to do the same. Take to the skies with me, my sons.
    For we shall know no fear and our enemy will know our wrath.&#x201D; <br>
    <br>
    As one, the five angels knelt before the Primarch and swore oaths to their genefather. This trust would not be
    misplaced and they would not fail. Raldoron the first of the Hayyoth and Equerry to Dante spoke: &#x201C;It honors
    me my Sire you trust us with this knowledge. I still must ask why you should risk your life for the possibility of
    saving the lives of a handful of holdout across Xeno infested worlds. Dante, my Primarch. I would rather die a
    thousand deaths than watch you fall to a threat as dire as this. Let us Astartes enter the fray in your
    sted.&#x201D; <br>
    <br>
    Smiling a sad smile the Primarch responded: &#x201C;My role to play is this. If an Angel does not bring judgment or
    guard the innocent it cannot be called an Angel. The Emperor created me to save those I can, and destroy those who I
    must. Your love and care for me is felt my Son, but I cannot ask anyone to face what is to come if I do not. The
    path will be hard but we will triumph. I would spread my wings and fly to my death gladly for mankind.&#x201D;<br>
    <br>
    Nodding solemnly the Hayyoth saluted the Primarch and Azkellon spoke: &#x201C;By our blood, are blades, and our
    brotherhood we will not let such a thing happen. We will fly wingtip to wingtip with you wherever you go for however
    long we can father.&#x201D; <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <i><u>Location: Bel-Haust, Capital hive of Hossak. <br>
            Date: 890.M30</u></i><br>
    <br>
    The IX Fleet exited the Warp in a flash of impossible color and distorting reality. They had traveled along the
    current of ugly death forged by the Ghost Fleet&apos;s voyage. Gellar Fields and Hexagrammic wards obliterated the
    colony of Nurglic Daemons feeding on the psychic-trail of misery and death. Like some great spear thrown by a
    primordial god, the IX Fleet re-entered real space in battle formation. This was not a mission of peace or even the
    pretense of diplomacy. Mankind&apos;s wrath had come and it would make the stars tremble.<br>
    <br>
    The Seraphim and its orbit of escort ships were the first to be noticed by Hossak&#x2019;s defenses. Cogitators
    screamed warnings of enemy contacts and targeting lasers locking onto the massive Flagship. The IX Crusader Fleet
    had warped into the primary Mandeville Point of Hossak which was in the range of two Star Forts, placed to guard the
    route from Hossak to Vostroya. For a split second, the Imperial fleet hung in the void as the Warp disgorged the
    last of its vessels. On the bridge of the Seraphim, Primarch Dante stood, peering across the Hossak system with
    superhuman and supernatural senses. <br>
    <br>
    Of all the Primarchs, few possessed psychic senses even close to Dante. Where Magnus possessed the most raw power,
    and Kalib Kraad boasted control beyond compare, Dante had the sensitivity and aptitude to observe past, present, and
    future with incredible detail. The Primarch felt the unguarded thoughts, emotions, and activity of the entire Hossak
    System. Dante&#x2019;s perfect expression was a mask of beatific stoicism, hiding his thoughts as he let his
    shimmering soul spread out across the system.<br>
    <br>
    He could feel it. The death, the hate, the misery, the sheer evil that infested this system. How men turned on each
    other for cursed power. Billions living and dying in city-sized death camps designed to keep a stable population of
    people as livestock. On top of it all, the gluttonous alien intellects of the Khrave slithered across the system,
    wearing stolen flesh and devouring the minds of innocents, leaving a cloud of broken souls to cover the local warp
    like some dreadful pall. The way the Khrave harvested&#x2026; They did not simply kill. The title of &#x2018;mind
    eater&#x2019; given to these Xenos was far too literal. As they consumed living prey, always living prey, the Khrave
    used their own psychic talents to feed upon the soul of whatever human was unlucky enough to fall in their grasp.
    Just as they sucked neural tissue out of broken skulls, the Khrave hollowed out there victims souls to increase
    their own warp-potency <br>
    <br>
    Their horrific actions left untold billions of broken souls to wander the shallows of the Warp, violated in such
    ways they could not even find peace in the Astronomicon. These pour things, for to call them souls would no longer
    be accurate, existed in a state of broken death. They were but scraps of souls, suffering immaterial dementia. Easy
    pickings for the carrion-eaters of the Warp. Normally in places of horror like this, where unprotected souls filled
    the warp, the endless hunger of Chaos glutted itself on these lost spirits. In the Warp around Hossak, the Great
    Powers were uninterested. The discarded scraps weren&#x2019;t even enough to gain the attention of the thirsting
    gods. They left this miasma to their most pathetic Daemons, letting the Furies, Chaos Beasts and other spiritual
    vermin enjoy this bounty. <br>
    <br>
    A single tear of stigmatic blood dropped from the Primarch&#x2019;s eye, splattering upon the granite floor and
    quickly fading from being. Unsheathing his twin blades, Dante read the minds of the traitors and Xenos upon the
    Star-Forts. Unsure of what was happening, they were afraid to open fire on a possible ally. Dante intended to
    enlighten them and ensure they died screaming. Raising up his left-handed blade. A cruel-looking thing of
    black-metal and a brutal pommel of red leather and rubies named Mephiston. Matched by a silver-bladed twin of
    cultured gold and other precious metals named Alatron. With his blade of wrath raised, the Primarch gave the order.
    &#x201C;Show no mercy. Today, we are Angels of Death and we shall show them our wrath!&#x201D;<br>
    <br>
    At that signal, over a thousand different weapons were discharged. Fighter squadrons of Xiphons and other patterns
    emerged from the flanks of the Imperial vessels. Enough lance-fire to melt a country smashed into the void shields
    of the Star Forts. The shields held but barely. Auger scans relayed tactical scans of the Forts. They seemed to be
    derived from STC patterns, but with strange Xeno modifications. Tumor-like growths of metal and flesh stuck onto the
    Star-Forts, latched onto docking ports like eldritch leeches. <br>
    <br>
    As the Star Fort&#x2019;s void shields attempted to recover from the lance bombardment, the second part of the
    assault started. A swarm of macro-cannon shells and solid ordinance shredded the Star Fort&#x2019;s shielding and
    blasting holes in the stations. Creating an opening for the final part of the Imperial opening salvo. Torpedos and
    Attack Crafts filled the void. Before the Star Forts flak defenses could respond to attack Imperial ordinance
    smashed into them. Armor Piercing Torpedos burrowing into its superstructure and ripping the Starfort apart. The
    Attack Craft barely had time to unleash their wrath before the two Star Forts were shredded to pieces.<br>
    <br>
    The Xeno tumors attached to the now shattered Star Forts split off. Undulating through the void like some primordial
    sea creature. These were Khrave Ships. As they moved away the vessels unfolded. Six &#x2018;wings&#x2019; stretched
    from the main body as films of energy bloomed between each wing, forming a web of plasma and more exotic discharges.
    The wings had formed into a star-shaped sail at the vessel&#x2019;s bow. Dante considered giving the order to engage
    but did not want to send his subordinates blindly into the unknown. The Khrave web ships shot away from the Imperial
    Fleet, showing acceleration that outperformed all but the most specialized craft. Fleet cogitators and sensor arrays
    worked to dissect any and all information they could from the xeno vessels. It would be needed in the days to
    come.<br>
    <br>
    At the Primarchs orders the Imperial fleet sailed towards Hossak, they would blast anything without an Aquilia on it
    to dust. It would have been well within the ability of the IX Crusader Fleet to blitz through the Star-Forts and
    reach Hossak before the infested planet could realize what was happening, but Dante wanted the Khrave to know he was
    coming. These were not mindless or twisted Xenos incapable of fear or panic. The Khrave were bizarrely and
    horrifically alien, but at their core, they were sentient parasites who from their earliest evolutionary roots had
    learned to fear one thing above all else: discovery and destruction by their host. Dante wanted the worms to know
    what was coming. He wanted them to understand that an armada they stood no chance against was bearing down upon
    them. The Primarch wanted some enemy cowards to escape deeper into the Rangda Empire and tell stories about what
    happened on Hossak. The Rangda and their vassal breeds had tortured the children of Terra without any consequences.
    Now they would learn to fear the Angels of Death. <br>
    <br>
    After a few hours of steady travel, the planet Hossak grew from a speck of light to a world. The IX Legion had spent
    these hours making any last-minute adjustments and preparations for the inevitably bloody assault. As the orbital
    defenses of Hossak came into view the true void battle started. Three orbital stations circled the planet. These
    were not simple Star Forts, but floating cities meant to house the Khrave and their most elite servants. A squadron
    of escort vessels and cruisers of various designs swarmed the stations along with a single massive ship of
    Battleship weight class or higher. Where the fleet around the orbitals was an eclectic mix of Human, Orkish,
    Fra&#x2019;al, Tallerian and other designs, the battleship, however, was distinctly different. It was bulbous,
    lacking in armament, and reminded Dante of the Terran pest called sowbugs. The sowbug ship had a small flock of
    transport craft rapidly leaving it, heading for the planet&#x2019;s surface. At that moment the Primarch understood
    what he was looking at. The Sowbug was not a carrier or battleship, it was a matter conveyor. A Xeno supply and
    trade ship of massive size. Gripping his twin swords tightly, the Primarch bared his teeth. Hossak was a livestock
    world for the Xenos. The sowbug was meant for taking slaughtered humans to market. <br>
    <br>
    At Dante&apos;s orders, the Seraphim charged its Nova-Cannon. The superweapon was loaded with an adamantium shell
    and fired at near light speed. The Imperials would send a message to the Khrave and their masters. One written in
    fire and blood. The nova cannons&#x2019; blast shredded clean through one of the orbital stations and split the
    sowbug in half, spilling its cargo and guts into Hossak&#x2019;s orbit. <br>
    <br>
    The first squadron of Khrave escorts flew towards the IX Crusader Fleet&apos;s own escort craft. Destroyers and
    frigates exchanged light fire, a prelude for what was to come. The Imperials were curious about the nature of the
    Khrave fleet. It seemed a ramshackle collection of salvage, barely united in weight class and nothing else. It was
    not even close to matching the designs or weaponry of the webships encountered before. As a torpedo from an Imperial
    Cobra blasted open the side of a Khrave frigate, the nature of the ragtag fleet became clear. The Tallerian hull of
    the frigate split open, revealing a milky white shell of flesh-plastic hidden under the outer layers of the ship.
    The Khrave scrap-fleet was neither scrap nor Khrave. These were not salvaged ships, used out of opportunity or
    necessity. These were Rangda vessels, wearing the husks of enemy ships. <br>
    <br>
    From the exposed Rangda core, the frigate extended a twisted nozzle. Swelling with alien energies, the turret
    discharged a gout of monochrome flames, smashing into the Cobra that torpedoed the Rangda frigate. The blast burned
    through the void shield-like acid, smearing itself over the Cobra&#x2019;s hull. The Imperial escort went dark, its
    cogitators, and crew going silent as the void. Yet the ship seemed only slightly damaged, scorched and twisted by
    some entropic weapon while still recognizably Imperial. <br>
    <br>
    Auspex readouts could not make sense of what had happened to the Cobra. The Rangda weapon had doused it with a
    bizarre combination of hard radiation, necrotic energy, and grav-distortion. It was a foul concoction designed to
    destroy anything living upon the Cobra, melting tissue and bone into irradiated ash while leaving a contaminated
    shell for the Rangda to use. <br>
    <br>
    The escort squadron charged the Imperial Fleet, but Dante would not allow them to get off a volley. The Imperial
    Fleet opened fire. Plasma and other more exotic munitions slammed into the Rangda ships, shearing off the stolen
    exoskeletons then blasting holes in the anthropic vessel. Milky white fluid bubbled from the wounds torn into the
    Rangda vessels, quickly congealing into a new section of the hull. The core Rangda vessels lacked armor, relying on
    their husks for protection. However, their techno-organic structure allowed surprising regeneration. Still, the
    tremendous firepower of the IX Fleet made quick work of the enemy defenses. Energy Weapons burned the Rangda
    Husk-Ships and Khrave orbital platforms into cosmic debris, creating a meteor shower across Hossak.<br>
    <br>
    At the Primarch&#x2019;s order, the IX crusader fleet spread out across Hossak orbit, identifying chief targets and
    any humans unbound by the Khrave camps. All across Hossak, steel rain started to fall. Millions of drop pods and
    bombardment shells poured from the void. Astartes Companies with Auxilia reinforcements targeted the countless
    human-farms and traitor cities across Hossak. Stormbird flights deployed from Battle-Barges by the dozens, adding to
    the deluge of Imperial might. From the holds of the Stormbirds squadrons of Astartes lept. Techno-Organic Wings
    inherited from there Primarch letting them glide through the sky. A host of Angels ready to bring mankind&apos;s
    fury. <br>
    <br>
    The Seraphim itself took geosynchronous orbit above the capital of Hossak. Bel-Haust, a country-sized Hive-Spire and
    center of the Khrave occupation. Lance Batteries opened fire on the Hives shields, relentlessly pounding the
    monument to Khrave enslavement. Fighter craft and squadrons of Attack-Drones poured from the Hive, exiting the void
    shield and engaging the Imperial forces descending from the sky. Bel-Haust stretched into low-orbit. It&apos;s top
    forming into a space-elevator from which Sowbug transports and other Xeno ships could dock. The burning wreckage of
    a Khrave orbital lay strewn around the hives outskirts. The void and ion shields protecting the hive had deflected
    or destroyed. The IX Legion would need to attack from the sides, where the shields were weakest. Destroy or
    deactivate the defenses if orbital weapons were to be used. <br>
    <br>
    This suited the Astartes and Primarch perfectly. They were not built to man void-batteries or grind an enemy to dust
    through attrition. The IX Legion was a force of righteous fury. They would take to the skies and bring death to the
    Khrave, with Primarch Dante Uriael at their head. Giving command of the Seraphim to Barchiem, Ship-Master of the
    legion flagship. Dante summoned his Ophanim Guards and prepared to join the battle. With Azkaellon at his side,
    Dante arrived at the Seraphim launch-deck. Flanked by his Ophanim, the Primarch boarded the Lord of the Flame, A
    custom Stormbird designed to ferry Dante and his elect to the battlefield.<br>
    <br>
    Alongside a host of thousands of similar Stormbirds, the Lord of the Flame departed. The golden color of the IX
    Legion craft shining in the bright sunlight as the Angel&#x2019;s host descended. Golden light rippled as they
    breached the atmosphere, in a formation that looked like a great pair of wings with a single Stormbird at the center
    of the formation emitting a star-like radiance. It was the power of a Primarch marshaling for war affecting reality
    itself. <br>
    <br>
    Angelic light and a swarm of interceptors protected the host as it dived through the storm of flak pouring from
    Bel-Haust&#x2019;s spires. The host dove from orbit to barely a mile above the surface in a matter of minutes. As
    the dive reached its terminal point the host pulled up, unleashing G-forces that would have easily killed even the
    strongest mortal man. It simply caused the Angels of Death to grit their teeth and brace themselves. Moving at
    incredible speeds, the Stormbird host shot towards the base of the hive spire. The shielding covering the spire
    originated near its top and could be easily punched through here near the planet&apos;s surface. Barreling towards
    the shields, static buildup crackled across the Stormbirds. Lighting dribbled off its wings like raindrops.
    Turbulence increased massively as they collided with the edges of the Ion-Shields. Lesser craft would have been
    shaken apart by the ion field attempting to shatter the Stormbirds. <br>
    <br>
    After less than a breath length, they passed through the Ion-Shield and pulled up, aiming to strafe along the
    near-vertical hive-spire, slowing as much as they could with the enemy fire still filling the air. The rear hatches
    of the Stormbirds opened up and the Astartes removed their restraints. One by one the Angels of Death lept from the
    Stormbirds, using their metallic wings to navigate upwards along the Hive using the updrafts created by the
    Stormbirds ascent and the Hive&#x2019;s massive size. The Stormbirds unleashed a flurry of Servo Skull interceptors
    to screen the Astartes&#x2019; arrival before pulling off to weave in between the Hive Spires, providing covering
    fire. <br>
    <br>
    The Upper Hive of Bel-Haust was the main center of the Khrave defense. It was an armored citadel perched upon the
    mountainous sprawl, a fortress-spire inhabited by the Khrave administrators of the world and their elite servants.
    Battery emplacements and docking gantries dotted the surface of the Spire, guarded by the most fanatical human
    soldiers of Hossak. These traitors scanned the sky, calling in sightings of the Stormbirds to anti-aircraft
    batteries. Armed with symbiotic armor and weapons gifted by their masters, they would fight to the death to preserve
    the Khrave world, hoping to achieve apotheosis into one of the &#x2018;nobility&#x2019;. <br>
    <br>
    These Bel Stormtroopers were the first to notice the second sun rising over Bel-Haust. From below the Upper-hive, a
    great light shone, growing with luminescence as it flew higher towards the hive. The Bel Stormtroopers turned their
    attention to this brilliance and saw their doom fast approaching. The Primarch of the IX Legion, clad in golden
    light and flanked by his Angels of Death had come to bring justice for humanity. <br>
    <br>
    Dante was a new star. His wings shimmered with mystical light and in each hand, he held a sword. One as pale as
    ancient Luna the other as black as the void. The Ophanim surrounded him in a halo of steel. All who looked upon the
    Primarch felt tears well up, awestruck by his beauty and ashamed of their sins. Dante&#x2019;s brilliant blue eyes
    seemed to pierce the very souls of the Bel-Haust stormtroopers. Since the most ancient days of Terra, mankind had
    dreamed of angels. Now one in the living flesh came for them. Some of the stormtroopers turned their weapons on
    themselves. The full weight of the atrocities they committed bore down on them and they could no longer take the
    guilt or the strain. Others simply fell to their knees and wept openly. <br>
    <br>
    With the force of a comet, the Lord of the Ninth slammed into the Spire&#x2019;s main dock. His impact bent metal
    and cracked the stone around him. Thousands of his sons landed across the Spire. A wrathful host came to break the
    Xeno grip upon Hossak. Squadrons of heavily armed and armored Stormtroopers, along with a pair of insectoid tanks
    and dozens of Khrave warriors poured out of the entry point to the inside of the hive as sirens wailed all around
    them.<br>
    <br>
    The Stormtroopers halted as they saw what they faced. At the end of the dock were the Angels of Death with a demigod
    leading them. A larger Khrave spat orders in accented mongrel-gothic, snapping the troopers to attention opening
    fire upon these angelic foes. In the time it took the Bel Stormtroopers to pick a target and fire, the elite of the
    IX had launched themselves forward at speeds the human eye could not fully process. One moment the IX Legion stared
    down the Khrave soldiers, the next the stormtroopers died. Bolt shell and power blade weaved through the Hive
    Guards, a dance of death that shredded hundreds of traitors to death in a heartbeat. <br>
    <br>
    Melta charges and plasma rounds ripped through the insect-tanks, blasting the Rangda vehicles into flaming bits. At
    the center of this carnage, the Primarch dueled the Khrave, fighting the lead Xeno that nearly matched him in bulk
    and three of its lieutenants. Dante spared a blade for each of them. The Archangel Primarch carried two blades but
    fought with four. Gossamer strands of silver that wove through his wings came alight with holy fire. The
    Primarch&#x2019;s mighty wings turned into two massive force swords. Imbued with psychic power, his great pinions
    deflected Warp-Glamour blades and struck out with divine strength. The three Khrave lieutenants were easily carved
    into pieces, their cut marks burning with golden fire, reducing the Khrave worms within to ash.<br>
    <br>
    The lead Khrave started to panic. It twisted its form in ways unnatural to a human and dashed back towards the
    entranceway, scrambling on all fours like some nocturnal predator. With a flick of his wings, Dante fired a volley
    of his feathers at the escaping Xeno. Meter long feathers charged with psychic light nailed the Khrave to the floor.
    It ripped at its stolen flesh in a desperate attempt to escape the Archangel of Death approaching it. With his black
    blade in hand, Dante approached the trapped Khrave, the cruel blade of shadowed metal dripped stigmatic blood.
    Frantic, the Khrave begged for mercy, gibbering in dozens of tongues trying to bargain for its life. The Khrave
    twisted its head to look the Primarch in his eyes and froze. Instead of magnificent blue, it had seen before,
    Dante&#x2019;s eyes were blackened orbs with a blood-red iris. His beautiful features were forged into a rictus of
    fury. Speaking softly to the Khrave, Dante said: &#x201C;I was born to be merciful. In extinguishing you and your
    evil kind, I will be a mercy to mankind&apos;s galaxy.&#x201D; <br>
    <br>
    With that, the Primarch plunged his blade into the Khrave&#x2019;s chest cavity and burned it with holy flames.
    Raising his blade high to the sky, the Primarch proclaimed: &#x201C;We are the Angels of Death! We bring the Dawn
    and scour away the Dark! Ave Imperator Ave Imperium!&#x201D; With those words, Dante and the IX Legion charged into
    the Upper-Hive. Entering the heart of darkness with blades aloft and righteous fury in their hearts.
