            So something I wanna explain before we get to the next part of the story is how exactly the Emperor effects
            the Warp. The Emperor of Mankind is an Anathema and his very existence and nature calms the Warp. He is the
            Lord of the Sane, of the Real and he acts as focal point for mortals and the Warp to focus and ground
            themselves. The Warp is a reflection of the Material and when sanity prevails the Warp starts to change.
            This is what I meant when I referred to the Emperor &quot;Poisoning the Ocean&quot; in &quot;Smoke on the
            Water, Fire in the Warp&quot; An Anathema is a being that taps into the desire for logic and order in all
            sentient beings just as the Chaos gods tap into unrestrained emotions and concepts. (this will be explored
            more in detail later in the story, along with what exactly IS an Anathema and where they come from) The
            Anathemas interaction with the Warp can be classified in a few tiers.<br>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li data-xf-list-type="ul">
                    Icon- The Anathema is a symbol and object of devotion. The Material Realm is protected from Chaos
                    passively and mythotypes related to the Anathema have powers against Chaos. (Basically the Golden
                    Throne Emperor)
                </li>
                <li data-xf-list-type="ul">
                    Paragon- The Anathema brings order where ever it goes and actively battles the forces of Chaos and
                    provides a counterbalance to the Warp and starts to force some elements of restraint and sanity into
                    the Warp (Great Crusade Era Emperor)
                </li>
                <li data-xf-list-type="ul">
                    Master of Sanity- The Immaterial starts to bend to the Anathemas will and Chaos state as Masters of
                    the Immaterium is challenged and their influence is muted. (The Astronomicon was the start of this)
                </li>
                <li data-xf-list-type="ul">
                    Lord of Order- The Chaos Gods Face an equal of incredible power who actively threatens there
                    existence and parts of the Realms of Chaos become Realms of Order. (The Farthest an Anathema ever
                    has gotten and the God-Emperor may be turning into a mutilated version of this.)
                </li>
                <li data-xf-list-type="ul">
                    Ascendant- The Anathema&apos;s influence becomes the dominant power in the Warp, Chaos starts to
                    starve as mortal beings start to become like the Anathema and Ascended past the influence and taint
                    of Chaos. (The Emperor and his predecessor&apos;s goal where the Chaos Gods would fade into myths
                    and the Material is Master of its reflection not a slave to it.
                </li>
            </ul>
            Yet as the Anathema climbs these tiers Chaos actually gets more dangerous until they reach the Ascendant
            level. As the Warp becomes more ordered the Chaos Gods become increasingly desperate like a feral animal
            backed into a corner. The order and logic pressed into the warp also start to allow the Chaos Gods to start
            functioning at a higher level. They become more organized and capable of higher reasoning. This can be seen
            during the Heresy when Chaos defied its own nature to unite and organize against the Emperor. Now as the
            Anathema grows and power things are going to get a lot worse before they get better. The Chaos Gods and
            their minions will become capable of long-term planning and organization at a truly horrifying level. This
            leads back to that epic clip I included, what happens when Nurgle and Khorne are capable of actually working
            together?: Hate Plagues, Tzeentch and Slaanesh?: Go watch Hellraiser or Saw. The going is gonna get rough
            and if the Galaxy can survive Chaos Rising then there might just be a chance to correct the mistakes of the
            first ones.
