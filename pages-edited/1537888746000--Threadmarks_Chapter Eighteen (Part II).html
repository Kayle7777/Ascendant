        Chapter Eighteen: The Battle of Ceres</b><br>
    <br>
    Location: Interior of Spire-5<br>
    Date: 812.M30 (30 mins since Cohort 5 made planet fall)<br>
    <br>
    The Interior of the spire reminded Sgt Hawkwood of ancient spiral fossils he had seen once displayed in a museum.
    The Entrance opened up onto a gently sloping spiral road that traced the edge of the spiral. Going left would take
    you deeper into the spiral and going right would take you higher up. A veritable horde of twittering Cyber-Altered
    Task-Servitors or CATS were released into the dark interior. Each equipped with a scanner suite and programmed to
    venture and scan anywhere not mapped by the Legion.<br>
    <br>
    The Predators took formation and prepared to descend into the Spire. Scans indicated the spiral road was composed of
    the same void-coral that made up the rest of the Spire. Yet it was more worn and damaged than anywhere else. It
    occurred to Hawkwood this was not natural erosion. It was an effect of thousands if not millions of slaves wearing
    away at it as they were moved by their masters.<br>
    <br>
    Suddenly those masters descended from above, like twisted parodies of bats the Xenos flew from the shadowed heights
    of the spire they dwelled in. The same twisted lighting that had been unleashed earlier by the Xeno Energy weapons
    crackled down. Lashing at vehicles and marching Astartes in great gouts of cancerous energy.<br>
    <br>
    Turret mounted weapons opened fire on the descending Xenos, Infantry Astartes deployed from their transports and
    joined the firefight. Bolt Shells, Volkite beams, and a few more exotic projectiles filled the dark cavernous spire.
    The Q&#x2019;Hrel had realized very quickly with the destruction of their Vanguard beasts that they were
    disadvantaged on the field of battle. Guile, ambush and as the Astartes quickly learned psychological warfare would
    be the stratagem of the Xenos.<br>
    <br>
    The psychological warfare in question was discovered as a squad of Jump-Infantry rocketed up into the darkness to
    strike the Xenos in flight. They were the first to see the next part of the alien attack. The squad captain voxed
    the entire Cohort in a brief warning of what he saw. &#x201C;Inbound bombardment, biological weapons
    likely.&#x201D;<br>
    <br>
    Ten meters from Sgt Hawkwoods Tank something splattered into the helix-road. Numerous Spotter lights fixated on the
    pulped mass of tissue. It twitched and slowly pulled itself to its feet. Even after a lifetime of slavery and the
    catastrophic trauma of impact the emaciated form of a human child was still recognizable.<br>
    <br>
    Despite not being Warp-Touched and firmly protected inside the Predator he commanded Hawkwood felt the warps
    corruption ooze off the child-thing. Some curse akin to what had kept the War-beasts alive animated the corpse. Or
    what had seemed to be a corpse. Its dented skull turned to face the nearest Astartes who was slowly approaching it
    with bolter-ready. The child&apos;s mouth opened and vocal cords raw from screaming spoke. The dialect barely
    resembled gothic and it was more of a bloody croak than a sentence, but the Astartes could understand it still.
    &#x201C;Make it stop, please make it stop.&#x201D;<br>
    <br>
    As it spoke the child lurched towards the Astartes, puppeteered by some inscrutable force it flailed its limbs
    uselessly at the Space Marine. Kept alive by foul sorcery the child&apos;s mind was intact enough to suffer while
    its body was used to attack who should have been its savior. With no hesitation, pity or remorse the Astartes fired
    his bolter and extinguished the last traces of the child&apos;s half-life.<br>
    <br>
    The battle continued and so did the bombardment, hundreds of mutilated children rained down upon the Astartes. They
    were terror weapons, meant to demoralize and horrify attackers. The Astartes only noticed them when they got
    underfoot or could be easily dispatched.<br>
    <br>
    That is not to say they did not have an effect on the Battle-Brothers of the First Legion. A cold brutal fury
    similar to their gene-fathers own ignited in each and every Astartes witness to the atrocity. The Xenos would be
    purged with ruthless efficiency, once the first Legion had finished its duty the only evidence of the slaver-scums
    existence would be within Imperial Archives.<br>
    <br>
    The battle raged and a handful of Astartes were slain under concentrated fire while thousands of Xenos were ripped
    from the sky. the Cohorts lead Chaplain opened up a general Vox signal and addressed the Astartes army as one.
    &#x201C;Our Armor is Contempt, Our Shield is Disgust, Our Sword is Hatred.&#x201D;<br>
    <br>
    As one the Cohort responded with the Hypno-indoctrinated response. &#x201C;In the Emperor&apos;s name let none
    survive&#x201D;<br>
    <br>
    For nearly an hour the 5th Cohort of the First Legion butchered the Xenos. The Q&#x2019;hrel were naturally
    physically tough and further augmented by sorcery and technology. The cold of the void or Ocean depths did little to
    inconvenience them. Even so, Bolt shell reduced them to pulped slurries, and Volkites burned them to ash. The
    puppeteered children could be dispatched with the destruction of the brain stem and posed little threat to the
    Emperors Angels. Even the Xeno energy weapons required several seconds of sustained fire from multiple sources to
    kill an Astartes. It occurred to Hawkwood the Xenos weaponry might have been designed to maim and torture slaves or
    beasts, not cutting through centimeter thick ceramite.<br>
    <br>
    The few straggling Xenos were killed by roving squads of sixth formation CQC infantry who had been supporting
    beleaguered fifth formation fire-teams. All were slain except one. A particularly large and gaudily decorated
    specimen whose left wing and graspers had been blown off. A faint mewling escaped the Q&#x2019;Hrell occasionally
    and it attempted to drag itself out of the ring of Astartes that circled it. An armored kick to its injuries
    dissuaded it each time.<br>
    <br>
    Hawkwoods Tank company was close by and watched the captured creatures meet its fate. It seemed the Infantry had
    been ordered to capture any enemy commanders if possible. The reasoning became readily available when an Astartes in
    the trappings of the Librarius approached the Xeno. The Q&#x2019;Hrel sensed what was coming and its efforts to
    escape redoubled.<br>
    <br>
    Witch-Fire streamed from the Librarians eyes and his Psychic-Hood crackled with Warp-Lighting. The sigils on the
    Psykers armor marked him as Telepathica Librarian, a specialist in ripping open the minds of the enemy and twisting
    the perception of the weak. The Librarian telekinetically restrained the creature, a mist of warp-frost coating its
    limbs. While he chanted psi-mantras to ground himself and focus his powers.<br>
    <br>
    All but the most psychically dull could sense what happened next. Like an adder sinking its fangs into its prey, the
    Librarians mind struck the Xenos. The Creature thrashed and squealed as knowledge, secrets and it&apos;s very
    thoughts were ripped out of it and analyzed by the Librarian. Centuries worth of Xeno memories were sifted through
    and the most important details were plucked away.<br>
    <br>
    The Librarian was thankful despite the Xenos appearance its neurology was not too radically different from humans
    and deciphering the memories was fairly easy. Tactical information was acquired and basic knowledge of the
    Xeno&#x2019;s language and communication methods.<br>
    <br>
    A small pack of Calligraphus and Vox Servitors were disgorged from the transport the Librarian had exited.
    Electrical bursts erupted from the Librarians hood and arked over to specially designed receptors attached to the
    Servitors. Knowledge torn from the Xeno&#x2019;s mind was injected into the lobotomized cyborgs. It was recorded
    perfectly by the Servitors and Voxed in data bursts to the Orbiting fleet who then analyzed it.<br>
    <br>
    Drained of its knowledge the quivering Xeno was released from the Librarians telekinetic grip. A brutal thrust with
    a force sword finished the broken Q&#x2019;Hrel, the tattered remnants of its soul burned in Witch-Fire. The Cohorts
    Lord Commander ordered a detachment of three hundred Marines to clear out the top of the spire and then ensure the
    security of the landing site and spire base. Spire-5 would be the beachhead the Imperium needed.<br>
    <br>
    Armed with new knowledge that quickly circulated through the Cohort and new orders from the Fleet the rest of the
    Fifth Cohort advanced into the Depths of Ceres. Down and down they went, the Helix-road showing no signs of ending
    until they were nearly three kilometers below the planet&apos;s surface. Eventually, it emptied out into a massive
    underground cavern.<br>
    <br>
    Stretching as far as the Astartes sensors could detect the Cavern was roughly cross-shaped, with the helix-road
    coiling down from the Spire-shaft that formed the crosses junction. This was an entry point to a great subterranean
    highway that connected the Spires, mines, and slave pits of Ceres. Carved from solid bedrock by ancient humans and
    widened and modified for the Xenos insidious purpose.<br>
    <br>
    Sgt. Hawkwood for a brief moment wondered if a Titan-Equivalent could be in these tunnels, they were certainly big
    enough to comfortably hold a smaller one or a Knight-mech. He doubted it, such a weapon would have already been used
    in the conflict. These tunnels were the size they were to allow easy transport of minerals and millions of
    slaves.<br>
    <br>
    New Orders came in, The Tank Company Hawkwood was part of would lead the scouring and conquest of the Northern route
    of the Highway. The Cohort would be subdivided into Four elements that would spread out and claim the subterranean
    passages for the Imperium. A senior Chaptermaster would each lead one while the Battle-Master would coordinate and
    oversee the occupation from the quickly assembling basecamp in the Xeno-Spire.<br>
    <br>
    The Fifth Cohort marched forth into the depths of Ceres. Each cohort-fourth formed an unstoppable tide that poured
    through the tunnel. Like a wave of cleansing fire, they blasted through numerous Q&#x2019;Hrel blockades and
    defensive positions.<br>
    <br>
    Recon squads occasionally splintered off into mining-crevices that dotted the cavern&apos;s walls. Most of the mines
    they explored were long abandoned, littered with the bones of long-dead slaves. A few held work-gangs of humans and
    Xenos. Utterly broken in mind, body and soul the slaves had to be ordered at gunpoint to leave the mines and head
    towards the basecamp quickly assembling at the spire. They would be useful labor until refugee ships could arrive to
    pick them up.<br>
    <br>
    The Cohorts main divisions butchered through the tunnel at a steady pace. Their orders were to meet up with any
    friendlies who had entered from different spires. This happened to Hawkwoods semi-cohort a few hours into the tunnel
    battle. A horde of Xenos and their war-beasts had tried to fortify a segment of the cavern into a makeshift bunker.
    The Xenos had the terrible luck to be assaulted by two different Astartes forces simultaneously. Forced to
    subdivided themselves to face the twin encroaching forces they were easily ripped apart.<br>
    <br>
    When the Predators Cogitators notified him friendlies were in the area Hawkwood ensured his crew was careful with
    their volleys. Avoiding friendly fire has always been a priority on the battlefield. Eventually, the twin forces met
    in the center of the Xeno encampment. Commanding officers exchanged pleasantries and information. The friendlies
    were a mixed formation chapter from Cohort 9. Plans were made to work together to clear a side-tunnel the
    Mixed-Chapter had discovered.<br>
    <br>
    Right as the joint operation prepared to roll out a massive planetquake shook the cavern. Stone cracked and baseline
    humans would have been thrown to the ground. After a few seconds of shaking it stopped. The tunnel settled and
    thankfully no debris larger than a human head fell from the ceiling. As the Astartes grounded themselves a simple
    message blipped through the vox. &#x201C;The Second Legion has joined the battle&#x201D;<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Location: Outer orbit of Ceres <br>
    Date: 812.M30 (Four hours since the First legion made planetfall)<br>
    <br>
    The Void was alight. Weapon fire from thousands of barrels poured from the Imperial Fleet. Lances, Macro-Cannons
    firing both material and plasma-shells pelted the surface of the Slaver-world. The grand shields of the
    Xeno&#x2019;s protected most of their spires but another six (with no deployed Astartes inside) towers were reduced
    to rubble by the bombardment.<br>
    <br>
    Mass destruction while certainly, an effect of the attack was not its goal. Eddard Fendragon had wagered
    Xeno-Vessels were hidden across and below the dwarf-planets surface. The Q&#x2019;Hrel fleet stationed in the
    Asteroid Belt was fast assembling and approaching, it was forming up into a single massive armada in hopes of
    challenging the First Legion Fleet. Having a second fleet disgorged from Ceres would prove a tactical nightmare. So
    the bombardment continued. All while Drop-ships rained down, providing armor and supplies to the advancing Astartes
    within the planet.<br>
    <br>
    Eddard watched on the grand-tactical map as new information poured in. Formed from memories stolen by the Librarius
    and real-time tactical data it allowed the Primarch to observe and coordinate the battle. A wave of green dots on
    the map representing allies slowly pushed the Xenos deeper and deeper into the planet. The legion formed an
    ever-tightening noose, forcing the enemy into less territory.<br>
    <br>
    The battle would only get harder from here. The planets depths had time to attempt to fortify, and any survivors of
    the hastily created defenses would further bolster the Xenos. This could not turn into a siege battle. The Astartes
    needed to crush the Q&#x2019;Hrel in one solid push. It seemed something located deep within the planet was the
    center of the Xeno-Fortifications. Records supplied by Malcadors agents indicated it was some sort of Golden-Age
    communication nexus.<br>
    <br>
    Taking it would be difficult but not impossible. The deployed Legion would encircle and pressure it. Forcing them to
    divide their forces, then Eddard would lead the First Cohort to breach the defenses and decapitate the enemy
    leadership. The First Legion landing forces were doing their duties well, but Eddard would not leave the Orbital war
    until his brother arrived.<br>
    <br>
    Small escort swarms from the Belt Fleet were already harrying the First Legion fleet. Spread out over the
    Dwarf-Planet in bombardment formation the Fleet was not in a state to handily win the oncoming engagement. They
    would, but at too high of a cost. This is where the Second Legions duties would come in. They would soon arrive and
    strike down the Xeno-fleet, allowing the First Legion to continue and win the ground war.<br>
    <br>
    The Second Legion should have arrived earlier to prevent this situation, Eddard could telepathically sense some of
    his Fleet-captains starting to wonder if moving into a more defensive situation was advisable. Yet even as the Xeno
    Armada got closer and closer to firing range Eddard held firm. He trusted his brother and had a strong (possibly
    psychically based) hunch of what Aleixo Garvia was planning.<br>
    <br>
    Those suspicions were realized as an urgent astropathic message blared through the First Legion Fleet. All it said
    was &#x201C;Hold Fast&#x201D;<br>
    <br>
    On all channels, Eddard ordered his fleet to brace for impact and swore internally to himself. The Xeno fleet was
    bunched up, all desperate to strike the invaders and help save their property of Ceres. Thousands of strange
    Xeno-ships and individual Q&#x2019;hrel massed together and prepared to attack the fleet. A few seconds later
    two-thirds of the fleet would be reduced to ash and plasma.<br>
    <br>
    The Second Legions fleet arrived into the battle, no, into the enemy fleet itself. While moving at a disturbingly
    high percentage of light speed. Executing a maneuver that had been labeled extremely dangerous during the Golden Age
    and barely theoretically possible in the Age of Strife the Second Legion struck.<br>
    <br>
    Alexio Gravia used his tremendous intellect and skill in voidcraft to perform a technique ancient Void-Admirals
    called Insteins Fist. His entire fleet under his careful orders and calculations had arrived at near light speed.
    Precise manipulation of the fleets grav and shield systems created a pseudo-bubble of normal void-conditions around
    the fleet as its Plasma-Drives accelerated them to relativistic speeds in a matter of moments. After a few minutes
    of this travel the vessels rapidly deaccelerated through auxiliary thrusters and further gravitational manipulation
    right on target.<br>
    <br>
    The end result was the Second Legion and Imperial fleet leaving Martian orbit and arriving in Ceres orbit after only
    a few minutes of travel The fleet was cloaked in a wave of plasma, as the accelerating had caused any matter
    encountered in transit to undergo a fusion reaction, detonating into a cloud of energy and radiation. Additionally,
    the sheer momentum of the fleet caused space/time itself to bend and twist. Forming a near-fold in spacetime as the
    materium tried to cope with the sudden creation and dissolution of a truly massive gravity well<br>
    <br>
    So when the Second Legion and Imperial Fleets arrived into the massed Xeno armada they did so cloaked in
    simultaneous nuclear detonations and riding an artificial Gravitational Wave. The cataclysmic amount of energy
    released was carefully funneled by the positioning of the arriving ships. Protecting the Imperial Fleet while
    wrecking devastating upon the Xeno fleet.<br>
    <br>
    Annihilated instantly the Xeno counter-assault was broken, gravity waves rocked the fleet like an oceanic tide.
    Massive fissures ripped open in Ceres crust. Some of the remaining unbreached or unbroken towers collapsed under the
    artificial tectonic stress. Eddard mused that sending his brother data of the battle had allowed Alexios genius to
    figure out a way to aim the gravity wave that efficiently.<br>
    <br>
    The First Legion Fleet watched with a mix of shock and awe as the wave of annihilation spread out and the newly
    arrived fleet took up battle positions. Quickly subdividing the Second Legion and Imperial Armada formed into
    hunter-groups. Each lead by an Astartes-Admiral tutored by the Second Primarch. They spread through the Asteroid
    Belt crushing any resistance and bringing the maze of rock and void-scrap under Imperial Compliance.<br>
    <br>
    Data, tactical information and more were rapidly exchanged between the fleets and Eddard was confident the Void was
    under Imperial Control. Turning a part of his attention to the tactical map he was relieved to learn there had been
    no fallout in the tunnels. They were deep and stable enough to protect the Astartes from the quakes, he did wonder
    how many slave mines collapsed from the attack. Acceptable but unnecessary losses, he would need to have words with
    his Brother&#x2026;
