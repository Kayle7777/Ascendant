    Primarch: XVI Horus Lupercal<br>
    <br>
    Foster World: Cthonia- Mining/Feral World stripped of all resources and home to vicious tunnel gangs that brawled
    over the planets Scraps. Brutal conditions and nearness to Terra allowed for excellent Astartes recruits of Genetics
    close to Terran Standard. Early expedition fleets harvested Chthonian gangers as Legion stock and an adolescent XVI
    was discovered. <br>
    <br>
    Discovery: XVI was biologically three years old and appeared a human male approximately 6-9 years in age. Discovered
    quickly and was personally tutored and trained by us. Served by our side along till VI was discovered and at first
    seemed the perfect proof of concept for the Primarchs.<br>
    <br>
    Capabilities: Under out tutoring he mastered every science and skill to learn and displayed a Charisma and social
    Intellect outstripping most of his siblings which allowed him to enthrall those weaker than him and befriend his
    brothers. One of the most martially skilled Primarchs excelling in decapitation strategy.<br>
    <br>
    Legion: Luna Wolves/Sons of Horus/Black Legion- The Geneseed of XVI was one of the most potent lines further
    enhanced by XVI&#x2019;s latent psychic abilities and possessed far larger numbers of Gene-synced Legionnaires
    including arguably the greatest successes of Lineage syncing and future leader of the reformed XVI Legion Ezekyle
    Abaddon. Preferred flexibility and command structure elimination tactics. <br>
    <br>
    Heresy: Loyal/Traitor- Was poisoned by Kinebatch weapon-host containing the Elder Neverborn known as Bruticai. While
    crippled by the Weapon a ritual lead by the Dark Chaplain Erebus reprogramed his mind and soul to have him start a
    Rebellion against us under the control of the Warp.<br>
    <br>
    Fate: Was put down during the Siege of Terra after we cast aside our newly reclaimed humanity and struck against the
    Four through his conduit to them. His Soul was erased to save him from further Chaotic predations and attempts to
    clone him were stopped by the Thralls of Imperious. <br>
    <br>
    Conclusion: Failure- Showed incredible promise and capabilities yet displayed numerous personality flaws related to
    egotism and abandonment that provided the chinks in his armor the Warp could infiltrate. Should have died a Legend
    instead of living to become an abomination.
