    <br>
    Name- Cognatu Ferrum<br>
    <br>
    Inventor/Manufacturer- The Emperor of Mankind: Created originally during the Iron War and kept in storage till the
    Unification Wars where it was installed into the Bucephalus by the Terrawatt Clan.<br>
    <br>
    Purpose- Psychic Intelligence: it is an Artificial Intelligence created using Psi-Tech. Designed to operate advanced
    automated technologies that would require computational and multitasking abilities beyond humans.<br>
    <br>
    Technology Description- The Cognatu Ferrum is, in essence, a psychic echo chamber that a sufficiently powerful
    Psyker can fill with their energy. The energy then forms a semi-sentient echo of the Psyker that acts as the
    operating system and Intelligence of the Cognatu Ferrum. Hard-Coded limits and rules are built into the actual body
    of the machine and prevent degradation or insanity.<br>
    <br>
    Physical Description- The actual body of the Cognatu Ferrum is a Land-Raider mass of Crystallized Warp Energy that
    acts like the brain and central nervous system of the Psi-I. This core is connected to a system of crystalline
    circuits that run throughout the Bucephalus and connect to all of its systems and allows the Ferrum to control it
    like a main computer would.<br>
    <br>
    Capabilities- Designed to be a replacement for the hyper-intelligent ASI&#x2019;s of the Federation the Cognatu
    Ferrum matches its Silica predecessors of a similar Class (Flagship Singularity Core) in both Processing Power and
    Multitasking capability. It is actually superior in atypical thinking and system orchestration. It can also use
    limited Psychic abilities to further increase its vessel-hosts Offense and Defensive abilities. (Precognitive Weapon
    Systems and Kine shield boosted Void Shields)<br>
    <br>
    Limits- The primary weakness of the Psi-I is its heavy reliance on a Psyker constantly feeding it large amounts of
    Psychic Energy. If this flow is interrupted the Cognatu Ferrum will rapidly start to shut down, with it attempting
    to ration the remaining energy. Due to being based on a human mind and soul while bound to the Thirteen
    Asimov-Zuklove Laws it lacks the ability to evolve and advance like a true Artificial Intelligence. For better or
    worse
