    Primarch: Primarch XIII Roboute Guilliman<br>
    <br>
    Foster World: Macragge- Civilized World and former Capital System of the Ultramarc League. Regressed into a
    semi-authoritarian but cohesive society. Maintained a decent technology base and was capable of low-level Warp
    Travel and trade with fellow former Capital Systems. <br>
    <br>
    Discovery: 8th- Ruled homeworld after avenging Foster Father&apos;s death at hands of political rivals. Forged
    Macragge and nearby worlds into a New Ultramarc League. Gladly joined the Imperium yet kept growing his own Empire
    of &#x201C;Ultramar&#x201D; <br>
    <br>
    Capabilities: Arguably the greatest analyst and organizer among the Primarchs. Excelled at planning macro-projects
    to the nth degree. Slightly above average combatant compared to others. More a builder and ruler of Empires then a
    warrior. <br>
    <br>
    Legion: Ultramarines- Highly organized tactically adept Legion that specializes in adaptability and discipline.
    Capable of fighting with extreme synchronization despite being the largest Legion. Regimental and doctrine heavy
    mindset can cause issues if lacking a leader capable of adapting to the situation.<br>
    <br>
    Heresy: Loyal- Believed Terra had fallen and sequestered themselves in Ultramar and were sealed off from the rest of
    the Galaxy by the Ruin/Storm phenomena. Formed the Imperium Secundus with I and IX. Eventually helped lift the Siege
    of Terra after the Duel. <br>
    <br>
    Fate: Crippled in duel with III and placed in Stasis. Rebuilt the Imperium post-scouring in order to try and prevent
    another Heresy class event. Invented and championed the implementation of the Chapter System. <br>
    <br>
    Conclusion: Semi-Successful- Proved to be one of the most psychologically stable Primarchs who helped salvage the
    Imperium post-heresy. Displayed a possibly neurotic propensity to order and organization that caused rifts with some
    Primarchs.
