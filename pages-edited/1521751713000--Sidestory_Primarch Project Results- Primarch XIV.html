    Primarch: XIV Mortarion<br />
    <br />
    Foster World: Barburus- Slave World ruled by PA7 corrupted Xenos. Toxic fog covered it and sheltered the Xenos in
    their high altitude kingdoms. XIV was raised by the chieftain of these Xenos and was warped physically and mentally
    by the toxins and abuse.<br />
    <br />
    Discovery: 13th- escaped his Xeno captor and started a rebellion. Met with him and noticed hints of corruption,
    issued challenge to analyze psych profile and capabilities. Failed but did not display corruption. Spent time on
    Terra and showed psychological instability. <br />
    <br />
    Capabilities: Extreme regenerative capabilities beyond other Primarchs and unrivaled bio-adaptation abilities
    related to toxins and detrimental environments. Lacked martial skill and strategic capabilities compared to siblings
    and used extreme regenerative abilities and strength.<br />
    <br />
    Legion: Deathguard- Massed infantry specialists who relied on numbers, sheer endurance and biochemical WMD&#x2019;s
    to best foes. Very useful in toxic or contaminated environments. Organized in massive Great Companies.<br />
    <br />
    Heresy: Traitor- Declared for Horus quickly and proved to be one of XVI&#x2019;s key generals. Experimented with
    Warp Craft on multiple occasions despite his hatred of it, in order to bind or destroy Warp-phenomena. Legion fleet
    betrayed by First captain (See Calas Typhon) and became thralls of PA7<br />
    <br />
    Fate: Atypically independent God-Thrall that rules over vast stretches of the Eldars Folly. Legion divided between
    his followers and those of his first captain. Ironically appears to have become a twisted mimicry of the Xeno who
    adopted him.<br />
    <br />
    Conclusion: Failure- His Armor of Contempt was mutated by his experiences on Barbarus into a paranoid hatred of
    anything he viewed as Warp-Tainted. (justly or unjustly) As unstable as VIII and XII yet better at hiding it. Severe
    physical and psychological ailments plagued him thanks to Barburus.
