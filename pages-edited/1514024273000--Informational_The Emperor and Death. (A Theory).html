            The Emperor and Death<br />
            <br />
            This is a pet theory of mine about The Nature of the Emperor and his power. I intend to incorporate parts of
            it into the story so I figured I would post the prototype version of it.<br />
            <br />
            The evidence seems to suggest the origin involving the Shamans is true, The Emperor seems rather powerful
            for that alone. The Shamans at best were probably at most around an Eldar Farseer in power, and if the
            combined might of a few thousand Farseer class Psychics were an actual threat to Chaos... Well, Slaanesh
            would be running with its.... tail between its legs. So a few possibilities emerge.<br />
            <br />
            A. the Shamans were much more powerful which is a possibility but considering what we know about human
            psychics, that many Alpha+ Psykers seems unlikely and flat-out dangerous.<br />
            <br />
            B. the effects are multiplicative which if true means Ynnead once its full power is unlocked will be able to
            curb-stomp the Chaos gods easily.<br />
            <br />
            C. is he stole most of his power on Moloch which seems unlikely considering he managed to seal the Void
            Dragon/Dragon of Mars away during the Middle Ages.<br />
            <br />
            D. is my personal theory. Which is incredibly ironic, explains some of the Emperors more dickish tendencies
            and also supplies hope for Humanity.<br />
            <br />
            The basics of this theory are that the Emperor is the Human Afterlife. We know the fate of Eldar and Chaos
            worshipers when the die (eaten/absorbed/collected by their gods) but what about Humanity in general?<br />
            <br />
            In &apos;Master of Mankind&apos; we saw the Emperor Summon up &quot;ghosts&quot; of Imperial Heroes to help
            in the War of the Webway, these could be psychic projections but what if they literally were the souls of
            fallen humans? This would explain why the Emperor is so powerful, every human not corrupted by Chaos fuses
            with him.<br />
            <br />
            This also explains why his appearance and personality appear to shift, he is a mixture of trillions of souls
            of varying morality and nature. The Emperor is not just the Master of Mankind but Mankind itself.<br />
            <br />
            Being the Human Afterlife would explain quite a few of the Emperors traits and abilities. His hatred of
            Religion makes perfect sense when you realize he knows \ the truth of the Afterlife, and how many Religions
            are touched by Chaos so they steal souls away from his protection. The Emperor&apos;s Xenophobia also is
            justified. All the suffering and death caused by Xeno&#x2019;s during the Age of Strife, he felt every death
            and betrayal.<br />
            <br />
            The Age of Strife would also explain how the Emperor became as obscenely powerful he is. How much of
            humanity do you think died during it? How many Trillions or Quadrillions of humans perished and joined the
            Gestalt-God that is the Emperor.<br />
            <br />
            The Emperor is humanity&apos;s champion and protector, it would make sense for him to not just physically
            but to spiritually protect humanity. He was created as Human Pseudo-Infinity Circuit to protect us from the
            dangers of the Galaxy and Warp.<br />
            <br />
            The hope in this theory comes when you realize how many Humans have died in his service in the Age of
            Imperium. It would seem that he had one last grisly trick up his sleeve even after the Human-Webway failed.
            The death and horror of the Imperium are the ultimate gambits, it feeds Chaos but also feeds the Emperor.<br />
            <br />
            This would explain why Chaos has not fully succeeded and broken down the walls of reality and why the Legion
            of the Damned (who appear to be Imperial Daemons) are appearing more and more often. The Emperor is growing
            in power and holding Chaos at bay.
