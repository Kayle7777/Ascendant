<br>
Records of the Slaugth trace far back to the earliest Terran colonization of the Galactic reaches. Covens of the Xenos manipulating frontier worlds were eliminated whenever they were encountered but they had always proved to be a mystery in both origin and goals. Eventually, a Slaugth fleet was tracked to a horrific Necropolis world showing signs of habitation by the cerebavore menace. An entire Federation Xenocide fleet was assembled and managed to wipe this abominable planet. Great casualties were suffered by Federation, and even the most advanced Preserver Class AI&apos;s could not heal injuries inflicted by their necrotic weapons. After decades of purging to scour the planet of every last trace of them, Xenoarcholigists entered the world and studied everything not claimed by the conflict or the Slaught attempting to maintain there prized secrecy. It was concluded the planet had been inhabited for millions of years and served as a cultural and bureaucratic hub. When reports of Slaugth activity trickled to nothing over the next few centuries Federation Command concluded it had been there homeworld and the threat was quelled for at least now. They were wrong.<br>
<br>
The Slaugth reacted to the destruction of one of there Feast-Worlds with a mix of alien surprise and annoyance. A fresh fodder race so young that their Evolutionary family could not even be traced to the Apocalypse War had managed to destroy a world of rest and wisdom. A Slaugth Feast World is akin to a human hive, shrine, fortress and pleasure world in one and acts as great points of convergence and communion where Slaugth agents bring their findings of the galaxy to. The Destruction of one was not an easy feat but not unheard of so they simply slunk back into the shadows and did what they had been designed to do, watch, wait, and listen. The galaxy then was still ripe with threats, the Eldest children of the old enemy still pranced through the skies and many fresh fodder Empires held power. Time was not right for them. <br>
<br>
When the Eldest Children rebirthed there forsaken child and the galaxy grew dark and cold something ancient and instinctual plucked at there minds. For eons, they had gathered information about the galaxy while helping push it towards the brink. All that data had not sat idle like that held by the time-bending watchers but sent through networks older than life on Terra to there creators. Now they sent a message along with the knowledge-burst. &quot;The Galaxy has unraveled&quot; <br>
<br>
Then Slaugth waited, they waited for the response as the galaxy broke apart into screaming horror and Three became Four. Though waiting they were not ideal. Artifacts held in reserve for literal geological epochs were activated, worlds were seeded with sacred virons and strategically valuable worlds were cleansed and prepared for what was to come. The Walking Worms were rewarded for there diligence when the first of the great Meat-Hulks arrived from the darkest wilds at the galactic edge. For the first time in millions of years, the Children of Rangda felt the light of the Galactic core upon there flesh. Veterans of the War before the First War returned to fulfill their sacred duty and claim a galaxy stolen from them thrice over. The Rangdans had come and their birthright would be reclaimed. </span></div>
