    For anyone who missed my little announcement, I decided to rewrite the second half of Chapter 15 due to it not being
    of the quality I desired. Hence why the delay. The updated and improved Chapter 15 part II is now published. Start
    reading around the bit where the Eldar Farseer gets in the immortal words of 1d4chan &quot;Soul-F#@ked&quot; to
    death. I have some good ideas for Chapters 16 and 17 while thinking about a number of one or two-page shorts to
    write. Ideas for the Legions and Primarchs are running wild and a couple of them have been mentioned in the
    forum.<br>
    <br>
    The goal is to get to the Great Crusade by Chapter 20 and have a few decade time skip to the early-middle of the
    Great Crusade for Chapter 21. I will write a few of those mentioned shorts in between those two chapters to sorta
    fill in the Primarchs and Imperiums early years. I hope you all enjoy my explanation for the Iron War and the
    Dragon. the Last bit of Chapter 15 should be out sometime this week. I am gonna prob take a few days off to
    celebrate my birthday and enjoy Darkest Dungeon (June Birthdays and the Steam Summer Sales line up nicely) Expect
    plenty of &quot;Just as Planned&quot; in Chapter 15 and 16. Then some Bolter Porn and Legion Curbstomping for 17-20.
