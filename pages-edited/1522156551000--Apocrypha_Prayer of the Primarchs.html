    Ascension<br>

    Imperium. For Loyalty is its own Reward.<br>
    <br>
    <br>

    <br>
    <br>

    <br>
    <br>
    The Lesson of Rogal the Praetorian: It&apos;s our duty to protect the Emperor and Imperium for, in turn, they will
    protect us and all we hold sacred. He on Terra endures eternally and so shall we.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    The Warning of Angron the Butcher: The Emperor acts in mysterious ways and we all have a place in his plan and
    Imperium. To despise your role in that plan is heresy most foul, and will bring His Fury upon you.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    The Lesson of The Iron Handed One: Be strong in the face of trials and tribulations. The enemies of the Imperium are
    many and we shall stand against them all no matter the cost, be it a sibling, a parent, or a child.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    The Warning of Mortarion the Hypocrite: There is no way to use the tools of the enemy to slay the enemy, for the
    taint of the Alien, mutant and Heretic infects all they touch. It also tells us to respect the Emperor&apos;s Divine
    Authority and Judgment lest we stray from his Holy Light.<br>
    <br>
    <br>

    <br>
    The Warning of Magnus the Witch: Danger and damnation await users of Warpcraft and Sorcery. There are things not
    meant to be known by Mankind and those who seek them out doom themselves and all they love. Only through Faith and
    Devotion to the Emperor can true power and knowledge be obtained.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    The Lesson of Vulkan the Eternal Flame: Through our works and devotions we can live eternal even after our body is
    dust and our soul goes to the Golden Throne. The truest legacy is not accolades or thrones but to help the Imperium
    with your life&apos;s works.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    The Warning of Lorgar the First Heretic: No god but the Emperor exists and faith in false gods leads to ruin and
    damnation. Devotion and Duty are the greatest form of piety and never allow yours to waver.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    The Lesson of Corax Raven-King: Justice comes to all, it is useless to delay it for the Judgment of The God-Emperor
    of Mankind will come to all who threaten his children. All those suffering beneath the Lash of the Alien, the taint
    of the Mutant or the Lies of the Heretic will be liberated and their oppressors shall face justice most
    ferocious.<br>
    <br>
    <br>

    Emperor will burn away all trickery and deceit until the Truth of Mankind&apos;s Majesty and that of its Master are
    all that remain.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
