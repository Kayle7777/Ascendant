    (This is only semi-Canon and not to be taken seriously.)<br>
    <br>
    Eldrad Ulthran was a rising star among the Seer Community of Ulthw&#xE9;, he had saved his Craftworld and many
    others numerous times thanks to his incredible gift of foresight. He was commonly believed to be the greatest Psyker
    of his kind since the Fall. An event he had barely lived through as a youth and that still was a raw wound upon the
    psyche of his people. Even now his home was stuck on the edge of the slowly expanding Abomination that had once been
    the Hallowed Crone Worlds.<br>
    <br>
    Eldrad worked night and day scrying the threads of fate for the best possible future of his people. He saw futures
    where a Giant made of Light broke into the Labyrinth Dimension and brought doom to his people, where Old Foes of
    there forebearers slithered back from there banishment to feed, and truly horrific ones where the galaxy burned in
    the fires of demi-gods manipulated ambition. Yet the events that currently were unfolding were unknowns to him and
    never hinted at even during his deepest delving into the Sea of Souls. A Wave of Psychic Power had blanketed the
    Galaxy and burned away at both the former Crone Worlds and them.<br>
    <br>
    Things made of psychic fire and primitive souls screamed through the void and crashed into the Craftworld. Eldrad
    watched in horror as winged things made of soul-flames roared through the void. They hardly seemed to notice the
    Craftworld and washed over it like a gout of warp-born solar wind. The Seer could only watch in shock as there
    Ancestors Folly shrunk before his very eyes as the flames scorched away the corruption. After the initial shock the
    Craftworld started to move, they were no longer locked in the Follies gravity well and were sailing free of it. The
    Eldar were transfixed as they felt the Sea of Souls shift.<br>
    <br>
    Reacting with speed and initiative Eldrad plunged into the Warp and looked for the source of the flames. A great
    psychic inferno to the galactic south lit up the Warp in a nonstop blaze of power that compared to the tempest of
    She Who Thirsts. Raw psychic power of a soul-scorching intensity and nature. Strengthening his wards Eldrad focused
    on the Fire-Storm and heard something. A faint song that played in the back of his mind. At first, he thought it was
    a simple whisper of the Warp but as he turned his genetically and psychically perfect mind to the song it started to
    make sense. It was not a song per say but psychic stimuli that would be interpreted as much by any psychic mind that
    could hear it.<br>
    <br>
    After hours of refinement and psychic tuning, Eldrad managed to filter out all interference and felt the song in its
    full horror. It was horribly primitive and even when translated through his psychic senses and into Aeldari it was a
    coarse bawdy tune that was meant for any and all listeners not kin to the source.<br>

    ^The Song of the Astronomicon as heard by Xeno&apos;s<br>
    <br>
    Horror and disgust filled Eldrads souls and he needed to steady himself. Even without his precognitive abilities, he
    knew a Storm was coming, a storm that would shake the galaxy to its core.<br>
    <br>
    (Yes it&apos;s utterly ridiculous and if you wanna take this seriously and in the story just take out the song. Oh
    and to humans, it sounds like an Angels Choir singing a beautiful never-ending hymn about salvation coming and the
    banishment of the Old Night)
