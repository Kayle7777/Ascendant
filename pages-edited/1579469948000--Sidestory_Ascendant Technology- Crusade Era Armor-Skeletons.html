    <b>Name: </b>Crusade Era Armor Skeletons<br>
    <br>
    <b>Inventor/Manufaturer:</b> Martian Mechanicum and Astartes Legions<br>
    <br>
    <b>Technological Description and Capabilities: </b>The Great Crusade showed the Astartes Legions required weapons
    and armor beyond even that available to the Legio Armor. Shortly after the unification of Sol, a committee was put
    together to design a series of &quot;Dreadnought&quot; class power-armor. Headed by Culain Mactursan the X Primarch
    and counting numerous Mechanicum Magos and Legion Techmarines among its number. This committee combined recovered
    STC&apos;s for Golden Age industrial suits, numerous designs supplied by a number of Primarchs along with schematics
    used in Martian Knights and Titan designs. Creating three new classes of Power Armor. Terminator armor, designed to
    be a heavy-duty version of traditional Imperial power-armor. Dreadnought class armor-skeletons, a combination of
    Golden Age Exo-Skeleton and Albia Steam-Walkers. Lastly is the formidable Dreadknight class armor-skeleton, a
    heavily modified class of Armiger Knight war suit. Each of these suits was designed to fill a niche in the Astartes
    armory. Providing different grades of armor and heavy-weapons as needed for situations where normal equipment is not
    suitable. <br>
    <br>
    <b>Physical Description: </b>Imperial Power Armor is often compared to &quot;a wearable tank.&quot; This is not a
    strictly accurate assessment. It is, however, accurate for Imperial Armor Skeletons. With the adamantium frame and
    thick ceramite slabs of the suits absorbing all but the worst blows. Massive muscle-fiber bundles and enhanced
    sensor suites allow for the use of weapons that an Astartes would struggle to lift under normal occasions.
    Terminator armor being the lowest caliber looks like a simply larger and better-armored version of Imperial Power
    armor. The difference is greatly expanded in the Dreadnought and Dreadknight class skeletons. With the Dreadnought
    class resembling a bulky, squat bipedal suit that wraps around an already armored Astartes. Slow and lumbering the
    Dreadnought can be best described as a vaguely humanoid tank. Dreadknights are heavily based upon Martian Knight
    walkers and borrow much of the design but with a few notable differences. Dreadknight armor is shaped more
    accurately to human proportions. Resembling a two-story-tall Astartes in full battle armor. With the piloting
    battle-brothers inside its armored chest cavity. <br>
    <br>
    <b>Limits:</b> All of the Armor Skeletons share the same basic weakness but to different levels. The Astartes inside
    suffers a severe loss in mobility in exchange for the extreme strength and durability gained. The Dreadknight avert
    this slightly, due to the repurposed systems of the Armiger pattern Knight. How-ever its massive size burdens it
    with new difficulties. Reducing the number of environments it can be effective in and making it an easy target for
    artillery. <br>
    <br>
    <b>Mech Suits Classes: <br>
        <br>
        Terminator Class: </b>A multipurpose armor-skeleton designed to fulfill any role needing mobile heavy weaponry. Its hardy nature and
    (relatively) small size allows it wide use on traditional battlefields, or cramped boarding actions or urban combat.
    Resembling oversized power-armor it is the poster-child of Imperial Armor-Skeletons.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Dreadnought Class: </b>Absurdly heavily armored and equipped with siege-weaponry. The Dreadnought class
    armor-skeleton is meant to wade into the thickest and messiest parts of a battle. Shrugging off colossal amounts of
    damage and destroying anything that gets into range. Enhanced life-support systems borrowed from Albia steam-walkers
    allow Astartes to fight on in this suit despite heavy injuries. This and its numerous redundancies make disabling
    the suit or its pilot extremely difficult. In times of crisis, this life-support system can be used to allow heavily
    wounded Astartes to fight when under normal circumstance they should be in a Sus-An coma. This practice is
    considered taboo and the widespread use of it as an ill omen. <br>
    <br>
    <b>Dreadknight Class: </b>Easily the largest and most powerful class of Armor-Skeleton. The Dreadknight blurs the
    line between Astartes infantry and Martian Titans. Extraordinarily expensive to produce the Dreadknight
    armor-skeleton, does not suffer from the nerve-drag and general clumsiness of its sibling suits. A trained operator
    can use the full range of dexterity, mobility, and technique they could normally use. Only multiplied by the
    Dreadknights size. The Legion elite who employ this armor-skeleton are used as champion-warriors against
    high-caliber threats. When deployed the Dreadknights face some of the most dangerous non-titan class foes the
    Imperium has. Including Greater Daemons, Orkish Warbosses, Aeldari Wraith or Flesh constructs, Rangda Theophages,
    C&apos;tan Shards, and other force-multipliers that can completely alter a battle.
