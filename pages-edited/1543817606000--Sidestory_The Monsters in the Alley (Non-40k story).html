    (A.N. This is a Short story I am writing for an English Class. It is the reason Chapter 19 is delayed. So as an
    apology I am publishing the first bit of it here in place of Chapter 19 part 1. I am considering turning this into a
    longer story and seeing if I can get it published. <br>
    <br>
    The Monsters in the Alley (previously known as The Flesh Golem)<br>
    <br>
    Date: 12/09/2077<br>
    Time: 1:35 am <br>
    Location: A dark and dingy alley off Michigan Avenue in Chicago Illinois<br>
    <br>
    Panic filled Max&#x2019;s heart, sheer unbridled panic. He hurtled down the alley as fast as his legs could carry
    him. Years of hard street living had reduced the former army rangers physical prowess but raw adrenaline made up the
    difference. The homeless Veteran sucked in ragged breaths as he charged towards the alley opening. If he made it
    onto the main thoroughfare the odds of him surviving the night would drastically increase.<br>
    <br>
    He was a few maybe twenty feet away when his something heavy smashed into the back of his skull. A sickening crunch
    echoed through the filthy passage. Max fell forward, slamming into the pavement. The warmth of blood mingled with
    the stinging pain of flayed skin as he tried to pull himself up with his skinned hands. A second blow prevented
    this. An ugly giggle accompanied it.<br>
    <br>
    Blinking away the double vision the first blow had caused he saw a huge dumpster a few feet away on the
    alley&#x2019;s side. If he could make it under it&#x2026; Thoughts of escape were brutally pushed from his mind as a
    sharp kick cracked one of his ribs. A pained yelp escaped Max&#x2019;s lips. Shaking from the pain he looked up and
    looked at his attackers. This was the first time he got a good look at them. When he had first heard them making
    their way towards him a 15 minutes ago survival instincts had told him to run.<br>
    <br>
    Looking at them was a mistake. It took Max a second to understand what he was seeing. For a second he wondered if
    his the tenuous grip on reality had finally snapped. Three constantly shifting figures stalked around him. Each
    seemed to change shape and color semi-randomly. Hideous imagery and faces occasionally flickered across their
    bodies. Demonic Faces, mutilated corpses, threatening messages. Occasionally a few second vid-clips of another
    street-person being beaten would show up on one of the apparitions torsos.<br>
    <br>
    Max felt himself start to hyperventilate as he worked to crawl towards the dumpster. One of the shifting-things
    laughed as it moved towards him. White-hot pain flared across Max&#x2019;s back as something sharp slashed through
    his clothes and skin. A slight involuntary whimper of pain escaped the homeless veteran. He cursed himself the
    moment it left his lips. Showing fear or pain to the enemy would only lead to more. His Drill Sergeant had beaten
    that into him twenty-five years ago. It seemed trauma, panic and an a PTSD spurred addiction to mood alterers had
    peeled those lesson from him. <br>
    <br>
    Almost on cue after his whimper, one of the attackers leaned in close and started to laugh. It was a cruel laugh,
    that of a vicious creature. Made worse by some sort of electronic modifier. Or at least that&apos;s what Max hoped
    it was. Max was still undecided if he his attackers were humans using advanced tech or Fiends from hell come to
    punish his sins. Max hoped they were human-monsters. Then at least his suffering would end in Death.<br>
    <br>
    The Laughing one then started to speak. Its voice was a distorted thing, neither male nor female. A mutilated mix of
    both, amplified and changed to invoke discomfort and fear. It kicked Max over so he was lying on his back, forced to
    stare at the monster before him. In a sing-song giggle it spoke to Max &#x201C;Weeeee caught you! You tried to run
    vermin but we caught you! Thank you for the lovely game, now it&apos;s time to have fun!&#x201D;<br>
    <br>
    Pausing for a second the Laughing One looked at Max&#x2019;s face, particularly the patch of bandages that covered
    the left half of his face. With a quick jerk, it reached down and ripped off the bandages before Max could respond.
    The Laughing one cocked its head, or what Max assumed was its head and laughed as it examined him.
    &#x201C;What&apos;s this? Looks like we have some bot-bait!&#x201D;<br>
    <br>
    The thing referred to the patchwork pattern of scar tissue that marred half of Max&#x2019;s face. A series of
    perfectly symmetrical and even wounds that decades later still required treatment. Visceral evidence of the incident
    that had started Max&#x2019;s downward spiral. His close encounter with a nanite bomb during the Steel Insurrection.
    Both body and brain had been permanently damaged by the technology used in that conflict. The Laughing One then
    leaned in closer and started to change. <br>
    <br>
    Its face was plastered with an animated laughing clown. Its body started to flicker countless colors in a
    kaleidoscope/strobe of sickening variety. The other two started to do similar, becoming a trio of psychedelic
    grotesqueness. Outlined clearly by its flashing flesh Max watched as one of its hands darted towards him. Instinct
    moved his arms into place, blocking the blow from cutting anything important. Again the ugly sensation of being cut
    lanced through his nerves. A gout of crimson poured from his forearms where a blade had struck. Max watched the arc
    of the blade and noticed something about it. The dagger that had cut him was not some hellish claw of a Demon, but
    an engraved antique hunting knife.<br>
    <br>
    That was when everything clicked into place for Max. His pursuers were not hellspawn. They were far worse, Street
    Cleaners. Street Cleaning was the code-word among the Ultra-Rich of Chicago for hunting the homeless for sport.
    Typically Street Cleaners were fantastically wealthy youths who got their kicks in by brutalizing societies weakest
    members. With competing cliques dueling over kill-counts and creativity in their torment. Max did not know those
    details. All he knew was when whispers of Street Cleaners showing up started death, torture, and Cops looking the
    other way followed.<br>
    <br>
    Max Seif knew he was going to die a horrible death. The Street Cleaners would torment and mutilate him until they
    got bored. He had seen what was left of their victims, bodies turned into macabre &#x201C;urban art pieces&#x201D;
    and strung up in places only the cities poorest even knew existed. New determination filled the broken former
    soldier&apos;s limbs. Frantically he kicked out at the Laughing Cleaner and tried to scuttle to the Dumpster. The
    kick missed and all three Street Cleaners giggled with cruel mirth.<br>
    <br>
    The lead one, all while still flashing in a sickening strobe pattern spoke: &#x201C;Oh it&apos;s got a fight!
    Fitting for a grunt who fed themselves to the nanites. We&apos;re going to have such fun! Ashton hand me the
    Bat!&#x201D;<br>
    <br>
    One of the Cleaners threw an ugly looking baseball bat to the leader. With sadistic glee, the lead Street Cleaner
    rained blow after blow down on Max. Nails hammered into the weapon ripped his skin with each strike. Still, Max
    crawled towards the dumpster, salvation was only a few feet away.<br>
    <br>
    The other two Street Cleaners soon joined in. The cold metal of a crowbar along with the knife&apos;s bloody kiss
    joined the cacophony of agony. The blows were not crippling, only painful. Max didn&#x2019;t know if some level of
    trepidation made them lessen their blows, or if the cause was sheer sadism. All he knew was if he could bear the
    pain and make it under the dumpster he might just survive. In a final burst of adrenaline-fueled movement, he lunged
    forward. He caught the underside of the Dumpsters lip and started to drag himself underneath. He was just a second
    to slow.<br>
    <br>
    Hands grabbed his legs and ankles, dragging him back to the torture. Digging his hands into the dumpsters metal so
    hard the skin broke Max screamed in desperate fury. Muscles long weakened by malnutrition and addiction pushed
    themselves to the breaking point as Max fought to pull himself under the dumpster. For a few moments, a grisly tug
    of war was played between street-dweller and street cleaner. It ended with a sickening crack as one of Max&#x2019;s
    shoulders was ripped out of its socket. The sudden dislocation was too much, Max&#x2019;s hand lost their grip and
    the monsters who hunted the streets dragged him away.<br>
    <br>
    Agony lanced through the ragged veteran&apos;s mind as he was dragged back into the center of the alley. The three
    cleaners surrounded him. Their shifting appearance warping them into grotesque creatures. Semi-Lucidly Max thought
    to himself that the shifting clothing they wore was supposed to scare and mimic monsterous archetypes. In truth, it
    seemed to just make their exterior match their true self.<br>
    <br>
    The lead cleaner leaned over Max holding the knife before his face. It seemed he had swapped back sometime during
    the struggle. Pointing the bloody edge of the weapon at Max&#x2019;s neck the leader spoke: &#x201C;Beg for me
    garbage! Beg for the privilege to pollute this world one more night. Grovel for your life like you do for change and
    pills. If you amuse me I might let you live.&#x201D;<br>
    <br>
    This was the end of the line. Max was spent, his blood was slowly forming a pool around him. He couldn&#x2019;t move
    his limbs and all he could feel was pain. Death or worse was all his future held. Peering up at his tormenter Max
    bellowed what he fully expected to be his last words &#x201C;Fuck you and Die! I am Max Sief Sergeant First Class of
    the United States Army Rangers. I will not die begging for a spoiled monster-brat. &#x201D;<br>
    <br>
    A bloody glob of spit into the Street Cleaners face accompanied this dying declaration. Caused the hologram that
    surrounded the cleaners head to be momentarily disrupted. A disgusted laugh was all Max could marshal, the lead
    tormenter was a fresh-faced youth. A skinny teen barely old enough to drive. Hurriedly the Lead Cleaner wiped the
    spit from his face and screamed at Max as his holographic mask snapped back into being. &#x201C;SHUT
    UP!!!&#x201D;<br>
    <br>
    The voice modulator the brat used barely covered the distinct pubescent voice-crack of the brats shriek. The Street
    Cleaner jabbed his knife into Max&#x2019;s chest. A yelp of pain escaped him as the steel parted his flesh and
    rammed into his rib. The Cleaner hung over him and struggled to pull his weapon from Max&#x2019;s bone. With the
    last ounce of his strength, Max bucked up and sunk his teeth into the Cleaners arm. Ripping nasty chunk of tissue
    out of the muscle. A pained screech left the brats as he fell back. The knife was dislodged by the Cleaners weight
    falling back.<br>
    <br>
    Bleeding profusely and barely able to talk Max muttered more to himself than anyone &#x201C;See you in hell you
    monsters.&#x201D;<br>
    <br>
    Grasping his arm and cursing the Cleaner ran over to the dumpster and kicked it repeatedly. A temper tantrum of
    violence that would soon be directed at Max. Lurching back towards Max and exchanging words with his companions the
    Street Cleaners prepared to finish the hunt. Then a loud crash echoed through the alley. The cleaners spun around to
    identify the noise. The dumpsters top had been crumpled, something massive had landed on it. A huge bulky shape
    pulled itself from the broken metal. As it did, a voice as loud and deep as thunder rang out. &#x201C;No
    More&#x201D;<br>
    <br>
    Faster than the Cleaners or Max could react, it exploded forward. Leaping between Max and the Cleaners, forming a
    wall between them. In the darkness of the alley, Max could not make out the details. All he could see was its sheer
    bulk and pale muscle. For a moment silence filled the alleyway before the heavens broke open. A torrent of rain
    started to pour from the sky. Then a bolt of lightning ripped across the sky and illuminated the thing. At that
    moment all three cleaners started to Scream. They had spent their evenings playing dress up, pretending to be
    monsters and preying on the weak. Now they faced the real deal.<br>
    <br>
    Standing nearly ten feet tall was a creature out of primordial nightmares. Human only in vague shape. Its body was a
    hulk of muscle barely covered by pale skin. Naked and hairless except for a pattern of surgical scars that tattooed
    its body. Shock enveloped the street cleaners as the monster raised a single tree-limb sized arm and pointed at
    them. Disproportionately long and slender fingers capped by razor-sharp talon-nails singled out the leader as the
    creature spoke.<br>
    <br>
    &#x201C;You have preyed upon the innocent for too long. Your hunts are over little-men. Flee and you will not be
    executed.&#x201D; boomed the monster.<br>
    <br>
    The Street Cleaners stood motionless, not able to understand what was occurring. Max couldn&#x2019;t either. Some
    giant haywire example of genetic engineering had lurched out of the Dumpster and now wanted to protect the wounded
    Veteran. Tension filled the alley as false-monsters and real-monster stared at each other. Then with a feral scream,
    the lead Cleaner charged the creature. Screaming in a petulant whine: &#x201C;That Kill is Mine! MINE! MINE!
    MINE!&#x201D;<br>
    <br>
    Survival instincts built into the spoiled teenager were trumped by sheer entitlement. No one had ever said No to the
    child. The Cleaner could not even contemplate not getting what he wanted. Violence and tantrums had gotten him
    anything he ever wanted until now, why would that change just because some mutant had shown up. The Knife that had
    nearly ended Max&#x2019;s life flashed through the air and stabbed into the creatures gut. The Lead Cleaner stabbed
    over and over. The hunting knife puncturing skin and cutting muscle. Any normal human would have been disemboweled.
    The giant barely seemed to notice.<br>
    <br>
    Pulling back the Lead Cleaner started to crow about the creature not even defending itself. This petulant
    pronouncement was cut short by a flick of the monster&apos;s wrist. Faster than the human eye could register two of
    the Giants&apos; fingers had been rammed through the roof of the Cleaners mouth and into his brain. The impact
    killed the human-hunter instantly and ripped his head clean from his body. A sickening ripping noise filled the
    alley as flesh, bone, and skin tore. The remaining occupants of the alley watched as the severed head flew through
    the air in a deceptively graceful arc. With a sickening thud, it landed a meter or so away from Max.<br>
    <br>
    &#x201C;I take that as your answer&#x201D; Responded the Creature as the shock of the near instantaneous violence
    settled in.<br>
    <br>
    With almost disdainful might the Monster drove its fist down onto the headless torso that teetered before it. Blood
    exploded out in a shower of gore as the body was pulped. The holograms coating the body flickered out of existence
    as the technology sustaining them broke alongside its owner&apos;s body. As the Street Cleaners body crumpled to the
    dirty alley the monster moved.<br>
    <br>
    A stone-shattering punch slammed into one of the remaining cleaners bodies. Turning his bones to powder and his
    organs to soup. The Cleaner flew back, the kinetic energy propelling the murderer. Displaying its inhuman speed and
    strength the Monster grabbed the second cleaner by one of its legs as he flew through the air. Then swung the
    Cleaner against the alley wall. Obliterating any remaining intact parts of the Street Cleaner, and detaching the leg
    the Monster held from the rest of the Cleaners body. A red smear bloomed on the wall as the now thoroughly dead
    cleaner slid down the wall. Forming a crumpled ball of crimson on the ground.<br>
    <br>
    This all happened in less than a second. The final remaining Cleaner had barely enough time to process his two
    companions were dead by the time the Creature loomed over him. As casually as a fully grown man might pick up an
    article of garbage the titanic Monster grabbed the last Cleaner by his clothes collar. Lifting the screaming youth
    into the air, and then slamming him into the ground at full force. It was grotesque. Blood and flesh were smeared
    across the ground. With the severed leg of the second Cleaner still in its hand, the creature turned to Max.<br>
    <br>
    With grace and fluid motion that should not be possible for something that big the Giant walked over to the injured
    Veteran. This was the first time Max got a good look at its face. Max expected a brutish simian countenance or
    something utterly alien. He did not expect the handsome noble features grown to fit the monsters proportions. It
    seemed an absurd gesture by whatever lunatic created the monster. To craft a Frankensteinian monster that could and
    would rip apart people with its bare hands. Then give it a face many models and actors would be envious of.<br>
    <br>
    As the creature loomed over him. Its bulk shielding Max from the rain. It spoke in a soft almost gentle whisper:
    &#x201C;I am sorry. I lack the skills to save you. Rest peacefully knowing you are avenged.&#x201D;<br>
    <br>
    With that, it left him. Disappearing down the alley, all while carrying the severed leg. Max watched it go and
    thought to himself: &#x201C;Monsters, they are everywhere. Beyond us, near us, and within us.&#x201D;<br>
    <br>
    In that dark foul Alley the ragged Veteran had encountered monsters wearing human flesh. Selfish, spoiled and
    sadistic Children. Who hunted those who could never pose them any danger for the cheap thrill and juvenile one
    upmanship. Humanities most monstrous aspects compiled into three of its members.<br>
    <br>
    Max had then been saved by a nightmarish giant born of human scientific prowess. Something stitched together and
    given false-life in an illegal laboratory. A marvel of progress that sought to protect while only being able to
    destroy. A Golem of Flesh set loose on Chicago, unbound by truth or law.<br>
    <br>
    Darkness started to take Max. His consciousness slipping away like his life-blood in the rain. Feeling the great
    beyond calling to him he wondered to himself. Were all the inhabitants of that alley this evening reflections of the
    species internal monsters. The Street Cleaners were products of runaway greed and consumption for the sake of it.
    The Flesh Golem warned of runaway technology. How are better aspects of discovery, and creation, could bring ruin
    just as easy as our worse. He also fit into this set. A monster that was once human, but broken by tragedy, and
    discarded. A disfigured and unhinged leper. Victim of both events far beyond his control and himself.<br>
    <br>
    The last thought that crossed Max&#x2019;s mind before the black took him was: &#x201C;It&apos;s funny that we fear
    monsters. Seems like we are the only source of them. We turn our inner ones into real monsters. Individually or
    together as a species. Humanity is monsterous&#x201D;
