			There is something that I&#x2019;ve been curious about which Jayfiction has mentioned: how does each individual Primarch perceive the Emperor when they look at him? I&#x2019;m fairly certain that Eddard would see a glorious battle-king, wise and fair, and I&#x2019;m sure Philip sees a wise philosopher dressed in simple robes, but what do the others see? Am I wrong in guessing how the two I mentioned see Him?

</blockquote>You&apos;re pretty on point. When most people encounter the Emperor it is their mind interpreting him through their lens of experience. So Techpriests see the Omnissiah, Custodes their glorious golden overlord, mortals view him as a beacon of hope, power and human perfection. Xeno&apos;s, for the most part, see him as an Eldritch Abomination. The Primarchs being his children see a bit more than that. They all see the ancient warden of the human species. Divorced from the species and still profoundly human. Still, they (as of now) are not beings who can grasp his full magnitude and as such overlay, their own goals and ideals on top of that baseline.<br>
<br>
For example, Eddard and Philip both see the Emperor as the Master of Mankind. The Guardian, ruler, and champion of humanity. What that means is heavily colored by their own being. So Eddard sees the Master of Mankind as the noble and heroic warrior-king that fights for humanities survival. Where Philip sees the Emperor as a wise philosopher-Lord who spreads enlightenment and wisdom to protect the species from its foes. Both valid and true interpretations of who he is, but heavily connected to the Primarchs world view and goal. The Primarchs see what they could be and how that relates to the Emperor&apos;s goal in him. Konrad Cruze see&apos;s him as the Judge of Humanity, Kota its liberator and avenger, or Marcus and Rogal both seem his as a builder and protector of civilization.<div class="sidenav-right"><a type="button" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="1551108238000--Threadmarks_Chapter Twenty (Pt II).html"></a></div></div></body></html>
