There are gonna be Squats. I have been on a Clamavi De Profundis kick and I have a few interesting ideas for how to handle the Squats. I imagine the Emperor being considered a Durin-like figure by them due to there ancestor worship. Also, Big-E is totally gonna appear Human Sized to the Squats because he would still be a Radiant giant to the angry little steampunk-stunties.<br>

Currently, my sorta plan after chapter Ten is 2-3 chapters about the Primarchs youths, the beginning of the Legions and the conquest of Sol. After that will be some Martian Politics and final preparations for the Great Crusade. The Crusade is such a massive thing that I am thinking the Chapters might be basically snapshots of battles and incidents throughout the Great Crusades. With multi-chapter chunks about some of the more important rival species or civilizations. Stuff is gonna get ugly throughout the Crusade, every breed of Xeno, noncompliant human and mutant is going to be at the gates with Chaos worming its way into the Imperium in the hope to either cripple or delay it long enough for &quot;Other Options&quot; to develop.<br>

Also hopefully I will be able to start writing at a faster pace since I am recovering nicely from the accident and some of the chaos from starting a new semester of university is dying down. No promises just a bit of optimism.</div>
