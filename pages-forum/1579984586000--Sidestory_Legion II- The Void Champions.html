<span style="font-size: 1.125rem"><b>Legion II the Void Champions</b></span><br>
<br>
&#x201C;For eons, mankind dreamed of exploring the stars. How lucky are we to fulfill that ancient ambition?&#x201D; - Alexio Gravia<br>
<br>
<b>Primarch:</b> Alexio Gravia: Imperial Explorer<br>
<b>Symbol: </b>Compass wheel on top of a Galaxy spiral.<br>
<b>Colors: </b>Navy Blue with white markings.<br>
<b>Capital World- </b>Fleet Based<br>
<b>Specialty: </b>Void Warfare (Naval Combat, Boarding Actions, Piloting Attack Craft)<br>
<b>Battlecry: </b>&#x201C;The Emperor favors the bold!&#x201D; and &#x201C;Into the Void!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><b>The 2nd Primarch  </b></b><br>
    As the Primarch Project moved past its initial phases, it became clear that each Primarch would be designed with certain duties in mind. With the first Primarch, the Emperor would have the ultimate general, a living sword for him to wield. Fittingly it was decided the second Primarch would be the ultimate admiral. The undisputed master of Void Warfare. Aleixo Gravia was born to conquer the stars. Gifted with an intuitive understanding of void-studies, and a genius for fleet action. Capable of mentally calculation complexities beyond all of his brothers, save maybe Perturabo. Alexio fulfilled his destiny in becoming the champion of mankind&#x2019;s exploration of the stars and conquest of the void.<br>
    While not as small as his sibling(s) Alpharius Omegon, Alexio is one of the shorter and leaner Primarchs. His body meant for the rigors of boarding actions and fleet command, not leading from the front upon worlds. The mess of curly black hair framing his laid-back features accentuate the easy charm of the II Primarch. Gifted with a natural easy-going charisma, Alexio cuts the image of the swaggering Captain of the Stars. His copper skin and semetican facial features bring to mind images of the ancient Terran sea-people. While the II Primarch prefers to use his capital ship as his main tool of war. He carries a pair of pistols on his person at all times. A duo of modified Volkite and Grav Pistols. One for soft targets, the other for hard. For melee combat, which he is loath to enter, he prefers to use his trademark pistols even then. Combining the speed and strength of a Primarch with the devastating effects of point-blank exotic energy weapons.<br>
    The true power and skill of Alexio Gravia can only be seen where he was born to be. Commanding his Fleet from his Flagship the Lance of Oanshar. The most powerful and agile of the Gloriana Class Super-Battleship. From this vessel, the II Primarch commands Imperial fleets with unparalleled skill and supernatural power. Combining psychic foresight, remote viewing, and technopathy to conquer the stars. Possessing a knack for grooming talent, Alexio Gravia possesses some of the most capable Astartes and Mortal officers in his fleet. While not at the command throne, the II Primarch can strike people as overly relaxed and uninterested in the minutia of running a legion. Unlike some of his brothers, Alexio trusts his officers to be far more independent and free-thinking in problem-solving and following orders. Alexio expects his subordinates to perform admirably and feels his duty is to guide his legion, not so much rule.<br>
That self-assured casual air and almost cocky attitude help make the II Primarch seem closer to mortals than most of his brothers. More like an eccentric commander than a demigod. That sense of good humor and approachability is the role the Primarch plays to encourage his subordinates and charm new Worlds. While not a false persona, this public face is only part of Alexio Gravia. At the helm of his flagship or engaged in daring boarding actions. The Primarch transforms. Becoming something truly ancient and primordial. Since time immemorial mankind has explored and conquered. Brave men and women of steely will and devious cunning have carved themselves into human history. With daring adventures, bold plans, and world-changing discoveries. Alexio Gravia is that drive to conquer the stars and their treasures personified. While in command that nature is brought forth. Showing a champion of mankind who inspires us to sail the void and claim the cosmos. A titan who strikes down all who dare oppose humanity&#x2019;s conquest with blade and blast.<br>
During the final preparation for the conquest of Sol. The Emperor of Mankind gifted Alexio Gravia with a powerful artifact. A tool of exploration and discovery meant to support the II Primarch in his duties. The Astra-Scope as it is called was forged by the Emperor&#x2019;s very hands. Its casing is a marvel of psychic crystal sculpted and inlaid with Auramite and Adamantium. Shaped like sphere containing a miniature of the Solar System, it comfortably fits into a Primarchs palm. Each miniature within the model is formed of samples from the respective bodies. The Emperor plucked a million years&#x2019; worth of fire from the Sun and forged it into a droplet of golden light. He ripped a nugget of molten gold from Terra&#x2019;s core and a shard of ancient iron from Mars. The Master of Mankind took these, and pieces of every other solar body. Then with this model system created he marked it with runes and breathed anathemic light into it. The Astra-Scope is a model copy of the Solar System infused with the light of Sol and the Astronomicon. In the hands of Alexio, it can guide vessels through the most perilous journeys. Burn away small warp storms, and most importantly provide a celestial compass that points to Sol and the Astronomicon no matter what.<br>

<br>
<b><b>History of the Legion</b></b><br>
    Even during the worst days of the Age of Strife Terra did not lack connections to the Void. Orbital Habitats, fleets of trader and raiders, along with a number of semi-self-sufficient stations near Luna were brought under Imperial control during the Unification War. From these peoples who knew the low-G environments and harsh radiation of the Void came the first recruits of the II Legion. The brittle bones and solar-tumors born of life aboard a flimsy vessel were replaced with the Transhuman flesh of Astartes. Where other Legions cut their teeth in enforcing compliance and purging new or newly discovered threats to Terra. The II Legion operated nearly entirely in the orbit of Terra. Garrisoning and crewing primitive Star-Forts. Engaging in sorties against pirates while patrolling Terra&#x2019;s early sphere of influence. The wide-ranging duties of the early Legion spread its members out more than any other legion. Forcing the Primarch and his commanding officers to adapt. Modifying the command structure of the II Legion to be less centralized. Legion command was required to be more independent than its cousins.<br>
    During the unification of the Solar system, the II Legion served with distinction. Crushing the Xeno fleets at Ceres almost instantly with the &#x201C;Instein Fist&#x201D; maneuver. An incident that would earn the II Primarch Alexio Gravia a reputation for daring and destructiveness. While the main body of the II Legion took part in the liberation of the Belt and crushing of the Ceres Xeno-Breed. Other strike forces were spread around the system, aiding Imperial Fleet actions when necessary. When the subsequent Lunar Crusade broke out the II Legion primarily fought to keep Imperial supply lanes free and used their Void-Presence to rapidly respond to any gaps in Imperial battle lines. They along with the V Legion were tasked with eliminating any surviving Chaos vessels that had escaped the conclusion of the battle.<br>
    While the main body of the II legion along with its Primarch left the Solar System alongside the other legions. Nearly a quarter of its vessels and legionaries departed Sol in the months after the Lunar Crusade. These ships and crew were assigned as additional firepower and protection for the first generation of Rogue Traders. These scout forces worked to ensure that Rogue Traders survived the first perilous encounters with the Galaxy and had no illusions of desertion or rebellion.<br>
    During the Great Crusade, each Legion followed its own unique pattern of exploration and conquest. They had assigned lists of targets and were required to provide scrupulous reports to the Adeptus Administratium. However, outside of these and a few other restraints, the Legions were free to act in a manner they best believed benefited the Imperium. The II Legion took this liberty with gusto and went far beyond the main expansion paths and war-fronts of the Imperium. It was not uncommon for other fleets to find compliant worlds and long-dead battlefields traced to the II Legion decades before the main exploration fleets arrived. Alexio Gravia&#x2019;s talent for navigation and void combat allowed the II Legion a level of mobility and independence only surpassed by the V legion. The reports from the II Legion and its remembrancers soon became the stuff of legend and propaganda. Stories of exotic worlds, mysterious Xenos, and bizarre cosmic phenomenon reported first by the II Legion earned them a reputation for swashbuckling adventurer. This propaganda role and the Legions skillset earned them the name of Void Champions.<br>
During the second half of the Great Crusade, when the Rangda Xenocides and Beast Wars raged. The II Legion was not dedicated to a singular front like some of its cousins. The Void Champions instead worked heavily with the Solar Wardens and Steel Warden&#x2019;s legions to ensure the safety of the Imperium. Keeping its war machine going to fuel the devastating wars in the North and West. That is not to say the Void Champion did not see combat during this period. They were called on repeatedly as a rapid response force to destroy Rangda ships that made it into Imperial space. Or as an additional Naval force required to beat back the Orkish Attack Moons. During this period the Void Champions and its Primarch became most famous for a long-running conflict with the Slaver-Cities of the Webway. Keeping the predatory Dark Eldar away from compliant worlds was incredibly important during this period of fragility. Famously Alexio Gravia led the first Imperial raid of Shaa-Dom, one of the largest Dark Eldar city-realms. Freeing millions of slaves and destabilizing the rule of House Yllithian.<br>
As the Great Crusade ended the Void Champions became increasingly interwoven with the Imperial Navy. Causing some concern among the Imperial Court. As a measure of good faith, Alexio Gravia ordered that when Imperial Navy and II Legion officers of equivalent rank worked together. The Imperial Navy officer would be given command. Throughout this period the fleet based nature of the Void Champions would be solidified. With a series of Star-Forts located at Segmentum naval strong points being the closest to a homeworld for the Legion. As the Webway Wars came to a close the Void Champion took it upon themselves to explore the labyrinth dimension and the countless worlds connected to its network. Working closely with the Lighting Riders and Arcanist Legions in this endeavor. An incident involving Aeldari defenders destroying a Gate that supposedly reached outside the galaxy piqued Alexio&apos;s interest. Starting the II Primarch down the arduous path of planning the Imperiums first extra-galactic exploration.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><b>Astartes Biology</b><br>
<br>
Appearance and Apotheosis-</b> The Void Champions suffer one of the more painful transformations into Astartes of the twenty legions. Not due to any particular gene-seed issue but the nature of its recruits and modifications to its Apotheosis process. To counter the low-G biological issues present in most recruits into the Legion, extensive organic modification outside of the usual Gene-Seed is required. Strengthening bone and cardio-vascular system from weak void-born things to the nearly superhuman states required for successful gene-seed insertion. A level of gallows-humor and shared comradery originates out of this ordeal. With neophytes given slightly more respect than other legions. Alexio&#x2019;s geneseed lacks some of the potency that overrides the features of his sons. Unlike many legions, the Void Champions lack few if any visual similarities. A slight bronzing of the skin and an occasional increase in the curl and darkness of hair is the most common features. This leads the Void Champions to be a very diverse Legion, with its members inheriting the features of their far-flung homes.<br>
<br>
   <b>Unique Organ-</b> The Thrumonyx System. A duct system that connects and modifies the Sus-an Membrane, Larraman&apos;s Organ and Mucranoid. Allowing the Void Champion Astartes to secrete an augmented hybrid of the product of all three organs. Quick clotting, low temperature conductive, chemically and biologically resistant black gel. Which can be produced in large amounts to close wounds and protect tissue from the vacuum of space. Allowing Void Champions to survive in hard vacuum for far longer than other Legions. The chemical process to create this Thurmonyx (or Onyx, as the Astartes call it) while energy-intensive produces oxygen as a byproduct. Allowing Astartes with damaged life-support systems to function in the Void. The large use of Thurmonyx cells also preps the body for Sus-an suspension if needed. Keeping the Void Champions fighting and active until they are safe or need to hibernate. As a final benefit, the Thrumonxy System modifies the Sus-an Membrane to give off small amounts of an exotic frequency of radiation when fully activated. Making it so Imperial sensor arrays can easily locate Void Champions lost in zero-G. For rescue or Progenoids extraction if needed.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><b>Organization</b></b><br>
<br>
  <b>Battlefield Deployments-</b> Void Champions operate near entirely as parts of large fleet actions. Either alongside battle-brothers or the ships of the Imperial Navy. The Legion eschews most ranks other than Sergeant, Captain, Fleet Master, and Void Lord. With Sergeants in command of a squad of Astartes, be they attack-craft pilots, drop-pod squads or anti-boarding defenders. Anywhere from two to twenty squads are assigned to a single Legion vessel, which is commanded by a Captain. Captains are categorized by the type of vessel the command. For example, a Battle-Barge Captain in charge of twenty Astartes Squads would be more experienced and higher ranked than a Cruiser Captain with three Astartes Squads. Fleet Masters act as Admiralty and high command. Leading a battle group from there Flagship. Giving orders to Captains of subordinate vessels and organizing the actions of Battlegroups, either as part of a larger fleet or as an independent force. Void Lords are those directed with control of entire Legion Fleets. Personally selected by the Primarch and trained under him for years. They are regarded as some of the best naval commanders the galaxy has. <br>
 <br>
<b>Homeworld: - The Oanshar Fleet</b>- Like every Legion, the Void Champions were offered an entire sector as fiefdom and recruitment area by the Emperor. Surprisingly Alexio Gravia politely refused his father&apos;s gift. Claiming &#x201C;The great expanses of the galaxy are my legions home.&#x201D; This was more than a simple metaphor. Throughout the Great Crusade, Crusader Fleet II had grown to be the largest and most diverse of its kind. Martian Arks, Jovian colony-vessels, Xeno envoys and traders, dozens of Magos personal vessels, an entire Battlefleet worth of naval vessels and countless other additions to the Astartes Fleet. The Void Champions skill and renown allowed an inordinate number of non-combat ships to fly alongside them. At the Great Crusades end, the fleet continued to grow. It&apos;s Cruisers and Battleships stripped away to guard the galaxy. More than replaced by millions of eager Imperials seeking to follow Alexio Gravia and his sons into the unknown. This titanic fleet along with fortress monasteries located at Port Maw, Bakka, Hydraphur, and other naval strongpoints provides most of the legions recruitment.<br>
<br>
    <b>Recruitment- </b>Over eighty percent of those recruited into the Void Champions come from void-born stock. Often volunteered to the II Legion by hopeful families and institutes on the many orbital stations used for resupply during the Void Champions constant migration of the galaxy. The Oanshar Fleet that follows the Legion Flagship also greatly contributes to this supply. It is not unheard of for Battle Brothers of the II to serve on vessels populated by distant relatives. Leading to some Void Champions being more connected with mortals than some find appropriate. The remaining supply of neophytes come from countless worlds the legion interacts with across the galaxy. Leading to the Void Champions having some of the most diverse recruiting among the Legions.<br>
 <br>
<br>
<b>Unique Ranks and Roles- <br>
<br>
Covswain - </b>The Librarius of the Void Champions possess a unique role compared to most Legions. Where most Legions use its psyker members as force multipliers or anti-warp specialists. The Void Champions use its Librarians as covens of magi who engage in large scale sanctified warp-craft. Each fleet holds a Covswain as these covens are called. Who holds the important duties of assisting these fleets navigation through both the warp and destiny. The Covswain psykers are trained to observe and manipulate the currents of the Warp. Augmenting the abilities of the Legions Navigators and using the Warp to the Legion&apos;s favor. A skilled Covswain can streamline vessels interacting with the Warp or manipulate the tides of the Webway. Allowing for faster transportation and protection from threats.<br>
<br>
<b>First Brother- </b>A somewhat honorary rank given to Astartes most trusted by a Legion commanding officer. On promotion to Captain of a vessel, a legionnaire will appoint a trusted battle-brother as an extension of his will and second in command. Higher ranking II Legion officers might have additional aids with similar roles. Who take titles of numerical sequences depending on the order of appointment. First Brother, Second Brother, Third Brother, etc.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><b>Legion Culture</b><br>
<br>
Personality-</b> Dashing, charming, bold, meticulous and surprisingly vicious. These are some of the words used to describe the Void Champions. The II Legion is known for having some of the most &#x201C;human&#x201D; Astartes in its Legion. A fact that has shaped the II Legion for better or worse. It is difficult to say that most Astartes &#x201C;enjoy&#x201D; what they do. The Hypno-indoctrination that turns them into Angels of Death removes there fear and an element of free will. How can enjoy war and death just as much as a fish can enjoy swimming? It is who they are and what they do. The Void Champions are one of the exceptions to this rule. Alexio Gravia and his sons love what they do. The exploration and conquest of the stars fill them with joy and a sense of accomplishment few Astartes can understand. Free-willed and adventurous, the II Legion exists to travel the stars and embrace the final frontier. This passion, however, can be a double-edged sword. Excessive thirst for glory and accomplishment mar the Void Champions reputation. Each and every Astartes in the Legion seeks to be the first and greatest. Seeking to prove themselves to each other and the galaxy at large. Astartes who have failed to control this impulse has been responsible for some of the worst failures of the Legion. The Void Champions are also renowned for having a closer and more friendly relationship with unaugmented humans working with them. Able to more easily relate to mortals and seeking to impress, the II Legion works well alongside most Imperial citizens. The roguish Void Champions demonstrate the restless passion that drives mankind in all its endeavors in typical transhuman exuberance.<br>
<br>
<b>Customs- </b>The Compartmentalized nature of the II Legion leads to countless varied cultural practices springing up among different ships and fleets. Some borrow elements from the tribal warrior-cultures they were recruited from. Or honor Millenium old traditions tracing back to some great victory or feat. Reverance and a close connection to Legion Vessels, however, are near-universal among the Void Champions. Attack Craft pilots often name and decorate their fighters with marks of affection and history. Larger vessels like Cruisers and Battlebarges host unique sub-cultures of the legion. Admiration for the vessels that carry the Legion and their machine spirits take many forms. One of the more common styles is the use of service-marks. A mixture of tattoos and ritual scarification to brand symbols related to a vessel into an Astartes flesh. Traditionally done as a mark of acceptance into a ship&#x2019;s crew. Old Void Champions often have a near tapestry of symbols and numbers covering their back. Marking every vessel they served on and important events on each ship.<br>
<br>
<b>Unique Features</b>- Stories play a large part in the customs of the Void Champions. Its Astartes collect sagas and experiences over there centuries of duty and share them. All seeking to tell the most fascinating tale. When crews (companies) or squads of the II Legion meet each other the exchange of stories marks an important rite. Each side seeking to impress with its accomplishments. The Librarius of the Void Champions also records the greatest of these tales. Documenting these strange and remarkable stories into an unofficial legion archive. Making it into this library of stories is considered a great honor of the Legion. Some of the most ancient and important tomes of this collection actually become psychically resonant. Becoming relics of power to the Astartes who are connected to it. Recently the Legions Libarius has been experimenting with psi-tech in recording these stories. To better harvest and use this accidental source of power. While the urge to exaggerate can overcome Battle-Brothers. A certain custom exists to stifle this. If an Astartes tells a story his comrades can not believe they have the duty to &#x201C;call&#x201D; this story and challenge the Astartes in question to complete a task of equal or greater merit. Forcing the suspected liar to prove his honor. Failure to accept this challenge or complete it is considered extremely shameful by the Legion.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><b><i>Battle Strategy and Equipment</i></b><br>
<br>
Tactical Doctrine- </b>It should come as no surprise that the Void Champions prize void and aerial superiority above all else in combat. The Legion possesses a fleet larger than entire sectors and puts it to good use. In the void, the II Legion put their natural aptitude for orbital mechanics and low-G physics to good use. The Void Champions train so that every vessel can play every possible role of its weight class. The crew of a Battlebarge can quickly transition from fleet-carrier to heavy ordinance platform. Mechanical restrictions forming the only lock on the vessel&apos;s effectiveness in its role. In large scale battles, the II legion uses this too great advantage. Allowing every vessel to play an effective role in whatever stage of the battle. When it comes to planetary assault the Legion operates under the doctrine of &#x201C;Steel Storm&#x201D; Where they quickly establish control of the planets orbit. Then proceed with a large scale bombardment of secondary objectives. Flushing enemy armies and leadership into their command centers. Corralled and battered the enemy now faces a mixture of drop-pod and teleportation deep-strikes. Designed to apply overwhelming Astartes power in a brutal decapitation strike. Often times Astartes pilots of Attack Craft are assigned to lead squadrons of mortal pilots. Astartes only squads are still the most common. Used for more precise missions where the mixed squads screen Imperial ships. Void Champion boarding actions are fairly standard Imperial fair. The only major difference is the unofficial tradition of capturing enemy vessels and turning them into improvised missiles.<br>
<br>
<b>Weapons and Armor-</b> Immitis Pattern Power Armor and Terminator Armor form the large bulk of the Legions infantry protection. The tenuous and cramped nature of Void Warfare makes larger armor-skeletons or other less optimized armor patterns unviable. The Immitis Pattern possesses thrust nozzles and traction spikes that allow for truly impressive maneuverability in decreased gravity. The mag-released spikes on the armors forearms and feet are effective punching through the hull of a starship, living tissue or anything in between. In the tight confines of vessel pathways and bulkheads. The versatile nature of this tool leads to its common use as an improvised and even preferred melee weapon. So much so that Void Champion tech-marines developed a modified version of Imperial chain-fist chassis as an upgraded version of the traction spike. This over-gauntlet weapon acts as climbing piton, punch-dagger, and close range spike-gun. This Void-Fist weapon quickly gained popularity across the II Legion and beyond. Becoming a Legion staple and standard for Astartes in boarding actions. Aside from this curious creation, thrusting melee weapons and energy projectile weapons are favored by the Legion. Allowing for quick use of destructive force in tight spaces and keeping Astartes safe from ricocheting solid muniton.<br>
<br>
<b>Fleet and Transport-</b> Understandably the Void Champions have easily the largest fleet of the Twenty Astartes Legions. With the Primarchs Flagship the Gloriana Class Lance of Oanshar being one of the best-crewed vessels the Imperium possesses. The Lance is not a beast of experimental weaponry or lumbering broadsides. Its raw specifications are only marginally different than other Gloriana and Super-Capital vessels. What elevates the Lance to a rightful flagship of the greatest fleet is its crew and command. Every element of the vessel, from its highest officers to the lowest menials are the best mankind has to offer. The crew of the Lance of Oanshar acts as one to operate the flagship with near perfection. Each and everyone invested in the reputation and success of the Ship. This focus on crew discipline and skill carries out throughout the Legion. The vessels of the II unified under the power of mortal and transhuman working to conquer the stars. Simultaneously while holding the largest Fleet the Void Champions hold a spartan reserve of land transports and vehicles. While still capable of operating armored assaults across the galaxies, the number is a small fraction of the Tank Columns available to other Legions. However, the Void Champions pioneered the use of an atypical pattern of Rhino transport. This Leuko Pattern Grav-Rhino is a far more compact and less armed than a typical Rhino pattern. Designed to easily fit through the main chambers of Imperial line ships. It is capable of effective three-dimensional movement and is outfitted with a wide variety of small and medium grade weaponry. The Leuko Pattern is designed to guard the inside of Imperial vessels. Rapidly moving to sites of enemy boardings and destroying the intruder. Lacking the armor and armament needed for battlefield use it serves excellently in this specialized role.<br>
