The standard line of thought both in and out of universe is that a complete uncorrupted STC will solve all of the Imperium&apos;s technological woes and propel humanity back to its golden age. This is sadly not true. The Iron War did not just destroy Galactic Human Civilization but also permanently ruined entire fields of science so that anything related to them could cause a galaxy-wide holocaust of organic life. All technology that relies on Artifical intelligence, Silicon-based computers, and information networking has to be scrapped to be never used again. Imagine what would happen to modern Earths technology and society if those particular facets of technology were completely off-limits, now add more than 20,000 years of scientific advances into the problem.  <br>
<br>
It&apos;s not just a simple case of recovering ancient tech, but of discovering entirely new forms of technology that humanity never knew about or needed to investigate due to the effectiveness of AI. The Emperor and Malcador have access to truly colossal amounts of Golden Age tech and knowledge but a lot of it is simply unusable without Chaos/C&apos;tan/Rogue A.S.I. contamination turning whatever your building against you in the most unpleasant ways possible. STC&apos;s that don&apos;t rely on this forbidden tech are not uncommon and will greatly benefit the Imperium but the vast majority of truly advanced stuff like what we saw with the Speranza is unusable. <br>
<br>
The Mechanicum comes into this with being one of the few organizations in the galaxy that are the jury-rigging old tech to work with safer alternatives along with making new advances with safer alternatives like Biologically based computers, Neurolinked Data-Nets, and Organic Robots. So while gathering STC&apos;s is useful and will speed up humanities return to Golden Age heights they are in no way an end-all-be-all solution to humanities woes. This is also why numerous &quot;complete&quot; STC&apos;s or hyper-advanced human-based tech was destroyed in the Great Crusade. Civilizations like the Interex or the Olamic Quietude were wiped out or at least did not have there tech integrated into the Imperium because they were headed down the path of either having there tech corrupted or another AI rebellion occurring.  <br>
<br>
We will see humanities technology resurge in this story with the Mechanicum and more tech aligned Primarchs discovering and developing technology to help advance humanity. Psi-tech will also be something to be played around with since humanities advancement into a species of stable psykers is the Emperors goal.  <br>
