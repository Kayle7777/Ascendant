			So, Star Child is the birth of the Chaos God of Order, Secundus is Imperium Secundus, The Hypothetical Successor State of the Imperium of Mankind, Dragon is the release of Void Dragon imprisoned in Mars.<br>

Anybody has an idea of what Malice and Terminus is?

</blockquote>You are pretty close to what I had in mind. <br>
<br>
- Star Child basically revolves around Malcador creating a New Emperor class Psychic to lead humanity or at least act as a figurehead.<br>
- Secundus is restarting the Imperium somewhere else in the galaxy if stuff on Terra does not work out.<br>
- Dragon is yes releasing the Void Dragon as a gigantic middle finger to Chaos<br>
- Malice is basically going radical inquisitor on the galaxy and trying to initiate a full-blown war between the Chaos gods to create Malal or something similar. <br>
- Terminus is whatever the hell the Terminus decree is</body></html>
