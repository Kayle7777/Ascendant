<br>
The warp much like the Ocean is a many many layered domains. Here is a quick rundown of how it works and what Eddard taped into for my story at least.<br>
<br>
0. The Surface: The Materium. Where reality has congealed into a single static and firm existence. The Laws of physics are firmly in place. This is the Domain of the C&apos;tan, who are in essence Avatars of  Material constants born out of the creation of the Universe. Here the infinite possibilities of the Warp are settled into one. Unfortunately, the Materium births beings that through actions and emotions stir up deeper layers. Much like how the Sun and atmosphere heat and cool the ocean. Every possibility and feeling is reflected in the Warp in some way, stirring it up and causing certainty and possibility to overlap. <br>
<br>
1. The Oceans waves and Meniscus: Warp Rifts and the Veil. This is what separates unborn and impossible existence from the settled material. Engines of Possibility (Souls) play the role of surface weather helping stir up this region causing it to breach into the surface. Yet just like the waves crashing against the shore it always returns to the ocean, just as Warp Rifts shut when there is not enough turbulence to keep them open. Super-Rifts like the Eye and Malestorm can best be described as Tidal Waves caused by massive disturbances in deeper layers created by insanely powerful events on the surface. Except unlike a tidal wave, the Sea of Souls does not eventually return to how it once was unless actively pushed to. Much like how a sufficiently powerful earthquake and tidal wave can swallow cities or landmasses. <br>
<br>
2. The Sunlight Zone: The Shallow Warp. Where Ships travel through the Warp. Diving into the Immaterial where the laws of physics are not set and using that to bypass them. Beacons and markers are easily visible here and it can be used for navigation just as the Sun is still visible. Here Daemons cavort, watching the Material and seeking to feed on it. Daemon Worlds exist in this Dimension along with most places visited in the Eye of Terror by mortals. This is the &quot;common warp&quot; seen and understood by the Galaxies races just a little bit. The thoughts, souls, and emotions of mortals reach here often and stir it up making it one of the most active and frantic dimensions. Possibility and Impossibility mingle, creating an eldritch and bizarre form of existence.<br>
<br>
(( The Astronomicon and Similar Warp Beacons pierce this far into the Warp. The Ascendent!Astronomicon goes just a bit farther and pushes back against the Pantheons while injecting some of its power into it ))<br>
<br>
3. The Twilight Zone: The Pantheons. Here macroscopic concepts and possibilities exist and can form into God-Beings. Ideas and emotions of similar breed flock together forming godheads reflecting common Material tropes. Most of these things are very short-lived nonsensical beings that cease to exist the moment any sort of reality is applied to them. The Old Ones discovered these macro-beings could be harnessed, the energy and power that made them up could be channeled into more concrete forms. Taking cultural ideals and beliefs, giving them form and certanity. Then using these Warp-Beings as tools of unimaginable power. During the War in Heaven, the countless safety protocols and mechanisms were increasingly ignored in favor of creating stronger and stronger Weapons to preserve all Life. Eventually, they went too Far and unleashed something truly terrible. Setting into motion a dread pattern of mad apotheosis. <br>
<br>
4. The Midnight Zone: The Chaos Realms. Macro-Gods exist as realms of existence that ever shift and battle. These beings born of ancient follies and material emotions seek to grow ever stronger. Feeding off their base components and stirring up the Materium in order to generate more. Here the material universes laws are nonexistent and its inhabitant&apos;s ideas and emotion concepts are blown out of proportion into nightmarish beings. Events and individuals that resonate within the Warp will birth aspects of these Macro-Gods. The amount of resonance determines the power of these beings. Every Soul is a reflection of a person in the Warp, and here that reflection can be magnified and mutilated into an impossible parody of its original form. The Person and the legend of the person can fuze and &quot;ascend&quot; into being part of this realm. Either as an aspect of a Macro-God or if they resonate enough as their own individual being. <br>
<br>
(( During a more peaceful era of the universe the Old Ones managed to &quot;inject&quot; pockets of Materium into the Warps reaches. Creating zones of reality within unreality. These pockets could then be sculpted and shaped into a network that crisscrossed both the Material and Immaterial. This is the Webway. The Aeldari Empire further warded this network with a Wraithbone-kin substance that protected it from the increasingly Caustic Warp. To ensure these bubbles from &quot;popping&quot; they have to be placed very very deep into the Warp. So ruptures can unleash all manners of horrors. These pockets were expanded and manipulated by massive Soul Engines that were operated by incredibly power Psykers or artificial Gods. )) <br>
<br>
5. The Abyss: The Deep Warp. The Raw stuff of possibility exists in its untouched form, everything that could exist and does exist since the big bang till Heat-Death exists simultaneously here. Tainted eternally by the actions of the Old One it is also the cradle of Dissolution. Where infinite probabilities become caustic nothingness. The Macro-Gods are aspects of this domain sculpted into mytho-types by sentient understanding but at their core are simply aspects of the insanity of everything and nothing. The Macro-Pantheon is it breaking through to the Materium, that once it did actuality would cease to be actual.<br>
<br>
6. The Trenches and the Wellspring: Infinity and Eternity. Beyond the Deep, Warp is the Wellspring of existence. Here the very substance of the multiverse, both Material, and Immaterial aspects are born. Known to the denizens of the Warp as the Wells of Eternity and Infinity. Everything that exists is born from this cosmic source, a seemingly endless font that pushes the expansion of the Universes ever outwards like an inflating balloon. With the Warp being the gas within the Ballon and the Material being the ballons substance. The Universes can expand infinitly for eternity unless something from within it or without it were to rupture it... <br>
^<br>
This is where Eddard Drove his Sword, to a place his Father knows all too well. Using the Warp-Reflection of the Titan-Sword to produce a gate. Sending the Shoggoth into a realm of untapped and unrefined existence. Here the Shoggoth simply ceased to be. Simply because compared to the source of existence and reality itself the Shogogth did not seem very real. <br>
<br>
<br>
THIS IS A VERY VERY ROUGH SKETCH. Subject to revision and details in in are purposly missing because of story reasons. Making sense of the ever contridicting lore that is 40k is painful but this is my best attempt to explain the Warp and the Universe.</div>
