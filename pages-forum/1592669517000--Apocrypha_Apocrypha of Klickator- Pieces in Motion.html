White and Black fought each other over the ruins of a demolished city.<br>
<br>
Battles similar to this one had been played out countless times before, but never with such powerful and skilled commanders. White was led by an inspiring figure, who knew exactly how to get the most out of every single figure that fought for him, while Black was a strategist without peer, a truly terrifying general that would display no flaws and find them in his enemies with uncanny persistence.<br>
<br>
The conflict started out much in the same way as its predecessors had. Both sides rushed to control the center of their battleground, with White being a hair faster. Its pawns were quick to summit the ruins of a particularly impressive skyscraper, but Black had been expecting it. Artillery fire rained down on their position, and they disappeared in a ball of rapidly expanding fire.<br>
<br>
No matter, they were pawns, and their job had been to reveal the hidden artillery units to White so that he could neutralize them. His valiant shock troopers dropped in from above and soon neutralized a good portion of the threat reap any more destruction.<br>
<br>
The battle went on like this for some time. White would make a daring move, only for Black to have anticipated it and have a perfect counter in place. Black would be but a single shot away from winning the day, but White would rally his forces into one last push that set back Black&#x2019;s efforts significantly.<br>
<br>
Still, they were both running out of resources and ideas. This battle would end, one way or another.<br>
<br>
White knew that his time was short. His precious captain had fallen. The commander had fallen  taking out half a dozen of Black&#x2019;s most valuable forces, but it had fallen all the same. Without a stalwart figure to rally behind, to enforce White&#x2019;s will upon the battlefield, his entire army was at risk from routing.<br>
<br>
It did not matter. White had thought this might happen. Black was a skilled player, possibly even better than he was, but he had a plan. His opponent&#x2019;s forces were outdated, unable to keep up with the new pieces that White had picked up in his many travels. He used one of these valuable tools now. Hidden away from the rest of the battle, far from Black&#x2019;s scouts or his more sinister methods of observation, lay the Messenger of Valor. Garbed in simple cloth, not a weapon in sight, the Messenger&#x2019;s diminutive appearance belied the fact that White did not fight this battle the same way his foe did. Every single piece of Black&#x2019;s army was a terrifying force of war. Lethal, terrifying, and immune to fear, White&#x2019;s forces alone did not stand a chance against the enemy.<br>
<br>
All a part of the plan. Black&#x2019;s forces may have been stronger, but that individual strength did not make their army better when they combined forces. White conducted his army with the belief that together, his forces were stronger than any that dared face them. The Messenger may not have been able to fight, but it conducted a vision of hope, giving White&#x2019;s forces a chance to move faster, shoot straighter, and be immune from the fear that would have normally gripped them.<br>
<br>
Blowing on an intricately carved horn, the Messenger sounded the call for battle and White&#x2019;s armies rallied as they charged forward. They were a glorious host, resplendent and mighty. Black could not hope to stand against them, and even now their forces retreated from the battlefield, their strategist knowing that his forces could not hope to stand against such a tide of courageous warriors.<br>
<br>
Something gnawed at the back of White&#x2019;s mind, however. Black was entirely too calm about what was happening to his army. Besides retreating and scattering his forces, he was doing nothing. No counter attack, no command of his own, he seemed to be doing nothing at all.<br>
<br>
White checked on his Messenger, fearful that Black might have a hidden sniper that could have struck down his lynchpin despite the fact that he was well guarded behind enemy lines. But no, none of Black&#x2019;s soldiers were in position, and none of the monsters that his opponent had brought to the battlefield could take to the skies and strike from above. What was he doing?<br>
<br>
As if to answer his unspoken question, a small burst of flame sprouted from behind Black&#x2019;s command line. A smiling face appeared, his eyes hidden in shadow as he vanished from being.<br>
<br>
A cold pit started to form in White&#x2019;s stomach. He had been outplayed. He hadn&#x2019;t been the only one to bring a hitherto unseen unit to the battle that day. He may have had the Messenger, but Black had brought the Thief.<br>
<br>
The Thief was a curious weapon, not unlike his Messenger. It would have been madness to deploy him in the throes of a battle. The Thief was supposed to skirt the edges of a fight, making his way to the opponent&#x2019;s side and stealing one of their units before returning to its master, and upon the successful completion of its task, vanish into flames.<br>
<br>
Flames had taunted White as they died down. He&#x2019;d been tricked. When his captain had died, taking down so many of Black&#x2019;s strongest forces and enrapturing White with a last stand that seemed to be right out of a storybook. That is when Black had deployed his Thief and pushed it towards his units. But what did he take? All of the units that White had planned on deploying were already on the battlefield, so what had he stolen?<br>
<br>
It hit White like a bolt of lightning. Black hadn&#x2019;t taken anything he had planned on playing. He&#x2019;d taken the few forces that White had kept locked away.<br>
<br>
They were White&#x2019;s only monstrous units. Large, muscular creatures that made their homes deep beneath the soil. White found them extremely useful in burrowing into the ground and springing up underneath the feet of valuable units that his enemy had wanted to protect. It was a great way to break morale and force his opponent to overcommit their forces in a rescue attempt. The only reason he hadn&#x2019;t prepared them for battle today is that their battlefield was dominated in the center by an urban landscape. His Burrowers were powerful, but even they couldn&#x2019;t dig through solid duracrete. They would have been useless in this battle. The contested areas were all paved over and industrialized.<br>
<br>
In fact, the only parts of the map that had soil were on White&#x2019;s side, far away from the front lines where he kept his most fragile units&#x2026;<br>
<br>
The ground shook underneath the Messenger&#x2019;s feet as a ravenous maw burst through the ground and opened its jaws wide as a Burrower swallowed the Messenger whole. Almost as soon as White comprehended what had happened, his lynchpin was gone and all hell broke loose.<br>
<br>
What he had thought was Black retreating and scattering was actually his opponent&#x2019;s cleverly disguised attempt to ensure that his forces almost completely surrounded White&#x2019;s leaderless army. Once the messenger died, their moral broke and Black&#x2019;s forces mopped up what little remained. Black was smart enough to leave a small opening free, so that White&#x2019;s forces had the option to flee instead of being forced into a desperate last stand because there was no other option. Whatever the Burrower didn&#x2019;t consume as they fled off the field, Black used the little artillery he had left to mop up the rest.<br>
<br>
As the final units in White&#x2019;s army fled the field, a Black soldier conjured up a flag from thin air and slammed it into the very center of the battlefield. The flag flapped proudly in placed as all the units in Black&#x2019;s army roared in approval, each of them doing a simplistic dance as fireworks erupted overhead as the word <b>VICTORY</b> appeared across the sky in massive golden letters.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;And I believe that is the game.&#x201D; Horus said with a grin, looking over at his brother with a supremely smug look on his face.<br>
<br>
Dante merely sighed. It had been a good match, but he had been no match for Horus in the end. When Dante had summoned Horus to join him in the Anahktor System and his brother Primarch had arrived a day earlier than expected, Dante was overjoyed for the chance to spend some quality time with his brother that he had seen far too little of during the Great Crusade. After exchanging the customary greetings between the two legions, Dante had practically dragged Horus to his private quarters aboard the <i>Seraphim</i> to show him the newly installed holotable he had commissioned from the Mechanicus. Although largely used so that Dante could receive data feeds of the IX Legion&#x2019;s progress in whatever theater of war they were in, it had also come with a program for the game of Ullatar installed, and the Angel loved to play with whomever he could.<br>
<br>
He had thought himself so clever. Many of the Primarchs played Ullatar, especially Horus, but there had been countless deviations during the Age of Strife, and Noonreach Cluster variation that Dante had discovered during his compliance of the worlds had allowed him to reintroduce the Messenger piece to his board. How foolish he had been to think that Horus didn&#x2019;t also have a trick up his sleeve.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Where in the Milky Way did you ever happen to come across such a rare piece?&#x201D; Dante asked with a shake of his head. He had known that losing to such a skilled general as Horus was a likely outcome, but he hadn&#x2019;t thought it would be such a decisive victory that caught him by surprise.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Our brother Marcus.&#x201D; Horus said with a wink, his warpfire eye disappearing for a brief moment. &#x201C;He offered it up as a prize if I was able to beat him. I was fortunate. Our brother is a truly splendid strategist and a terrifying logistician, but utterly predictable. He will do the same moves over and over again until given enough data that he is convinced to change. He would have beaten me too, but I swapped notes with Kota after their own match, and that gave me all the advantage I needed.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I would appreciate it if you didn&#x2019;t tell Rogal about my little trick.&#x201D; the Revenant Son continued. &#x201C;We are to have our own match soon enough, and he has a beautiful unit I would dearly love to have a copy of in my army.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I suppose you will be wanting my Messenger, then.&#x201D; Dante groaned.<br>
<br>
Horus simply shook his head, pushing the data slate back into his brother&#x2019;s hands when Dante offered it to him.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;No, no. It is not my play style, and you deserve to keep it after such a fine match. You sell yourself short, my brother. Your skills at Ullatar are truly fearsome, and you should take pride in such a well played match.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Dante nodded his head, but there was still a little sting to his pride that would not go away. Horus hadn&#x2019;t exactly tricked him, but it was clear that the IX Primarch had been played for a fool. It wasn&#x2019;t a feeling that he was used to, and something that worried him if he was ever tricked in a real battle.<br>
<br>
Sensing something was amiss, Horus put an arm around his brother&#x2019;s massive shoulders and escorted him to the nearest viewport. The <i>Seraphim</i> was in orbit around a tiny planet called Anahktor Extremis, an airless world that had until recently been a military garrison for the totalitarian regime that ruled this system. The IX Legion had already cleared the place of enemy forces, and it was currently acting as a staging ground for the Imperium invasion of the inner system.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Come now, I know that you didn&#x2019;t ask me here just to play a strategy game, though I know we both love them.&#x201D; Horus said with a chuckle. &#x201C;Why is it that you have asked me here, brother? Say the word, and the Lunar Templars are at your disposal.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
As Dante looked back at Horus, the XVI Primarch saw the radiant beauty that flowed from his brother as he became more relaxed and sure of himself. Their father had made them all for specific purposes, and it was clear to any of the Primarchs that spent time around Dante that he was an Angel. A beautiful figure meant to inspire awe and be the public face of the transhuman protectors of mankind. As Horus looked upon him now, he could not think of a better person for that role.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;This is Anahktor Extremis.&#x201D; Dante said, gesturing out to the barren world below them. &#x201C;The outermost system of the empire that rules here. They are a vicious bunch, laying waste to star systems all around them in order to provide for their people. Their soldiers are heavily augmented gene monsters. My men have taken to calling them &#x2018;Iron Bulls&#x2019;, for sake of the massive receptor horns they have atop their heads.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Horus nodded as he brought up more information about their new enemy. Veritable libraries of information about the Iron Bulls and their tyrannical overlords were being given to the Lupercali as his transhuman brain listened with perfect clarity to what his brother was saying.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It seems your legion made quick work of this first outpost.&#x201D; Horus said, nodding his approval of his brother&#x2019;s tactics. It had been strategically flawless, and played to the IX&#x2019;s strengths. &#x201C;Why is it that you have summoned me? This seems like something that you alone could handle, and I know that you do not doubt yourself enough to believe you are not up for the task.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Dante shook his head, forestalling any other objections Horus had.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I know my legion could do it.&#x201D; he continued. &#x201C;My sons have not yet faced an enemy that could halt the destiny of mankind, and these Iron Bulls are no different. No, I have called you here because of something that will happen that will be mitigated by your presence.&#x201D;<br>
With a wave of his hand, the holotable in the center of the Primarch&#x2019;s quarters displayed a heavily augmented diplomat on his hands and knees in supplication, uttering a strange language in a hushed tone.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;My librarius says that this is an offer of surrender.&#x201D; Dante explained. &#x201C;The tyrants of this system no longer wish to fight, and will surrender to Imperial forces within a fortnight.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Horus nodded, but stayed silent. There was clearly something else at work here.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;To confirm, I communed with my Grigori choir.&#x201D; the Angel continued, his wings expanding ever so slightly as he spoke. &#x201C;Their assistance has allowed my foresight to see that this is nothing but a sham, an opportunity for the Iron Bulls to assassinate me.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Were you not tempted to use this foresight during our game?&#x201D; Horus asked with a chuckle. &#x201C;If I ever play Konrad, I shall have to keep in mind he shall see my Thief coming before it ever gets to his side of the table.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;My sight does not work like that.&#x201D; Dante said, rolling his eyes at his brother&#x2019;s playfulness. He knew that there was no malice behind Horus&#x2019; jest, nor a shirking of his responsibilities. It was merely another way that Horus grew close to the people he cared about, and Dante was grateful to be among that esteemed company.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The more &#x2018;important&#x2019; and related to me, the clearer the visions.&#x201D; he continued.&#x201D; The Grigori Choir is required for any form of long term accurate prediction. For something like a game of Ullatar with no major stakes, I would not be able to see much of anything. Since my victory or loss has little effect on the strands of fate. I cannot see the complete future, Horus, but I can see points where destiny changes. Losing to you in Ullatar? My destiny remains the same. Getting blown up by a smuggled nuclear warhead? That would alter it slightly.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Horus snorted at that. Dante may not have been as outwardly humorous as Ogadin or Baraca, but his dry humor was appreciated. It was one of the reasons that he and Phillip were Lupercali&#x2019;s dearest friends among their brotherhood.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I have seen it all, Horus.&#x201D; Dante said. &#x201C;How my sons die in the fires of dishonor, and how my troops are overcome by such a terrible rage that we destroy every single shred of evidence humanity ever resided in this system. For thousands of years, my legion will use the story of what we did here as a story to scare novices and serfs, as well as remind their battle-brothers that there is a dark side to our glory.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
He slammed his fist down on the holotable, the frozen image of the diplomat flicked slightly as he did.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I refuse to let it happen. Ours is a tale of honor and glory, not fire and blood. We are supposed to be an inspiration for mankind, not a warning. The future ahead is dark and grim, but it does not have to be.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;And that is where I come in.&#x201D; Horus said, finally understanding.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Indeed.&#x201D; Dante replied with a nod. &#x201C;Retaliation will be needed, but it need not be a massacre. Your legion is second to none when it comes to command decapitation strikes. I shall be the anvil, and you the hammer. Together, we will wipe out the Iron Bulls, and save the common people, so that they too can walk upon the Shining Path.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Horus could see it now. Piles upon piles of bodies that would have littered the inner worlds would be saved. He might have lost to Horus, but Dante was a brilliant strategist, and the Angel was betting that the Tyrants of Anahktor would fall to their knees in awestruck horror when the might of two legions crashed down upon them. Many of the inner worlds would surrender without so much as a round fired in anger, such was the sheer intimidation the Lunar Templars and the IX Legion would bring. Once fully compliant, the system would see the Mechanicum of Mars find many boons upon the Anahktor worlds that would have perished in the flames of war. Eventually, this system would go on to have a storied history as a series of forge worlds that produced some of the finest bionics in the entire Imperium of Man.<br>
<br>
First, Horus would have to assist his brother in conquering the system, and there was no Thief he could hide this time. Data streams fed to him told the Lupercali that he had several hours to prepare for this fight before the ships carrying the Anahktor assassins arrived. He would use that time to consult with his captains and Dante about the best strategies his forces could employ to minimize casualties and ensure complete victory.<br>
<br>
As he voxed Abaddon to meet him on the bridge of the <i>Seraphim</i>, Horus could not help but let out a small smile. This was much better than any holotable. And with Dante at his side, there was nowhere else he would rather be.<br>
