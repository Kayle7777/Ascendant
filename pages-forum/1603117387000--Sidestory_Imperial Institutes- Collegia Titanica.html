<b>Collegia Titanica: </b>God-Engines of Mankind<br>
<br>
<b>Description: </b>The Collegia Titanica is the unified military body of the Imperium dealing with Titan Machines. Defined as upright walking weapons platforms with more than one pilot. The Collegia oversees the construction, maintenance, and deployment of these machines. The military branch of the Collegia Titanitca is known as the Legio Titanicus and is made up of numerous Ordos, which are individual military forces and commonly known as Titan Legions. The Collegia traces back to ancient pre-Age of Strife military conventions of organized mech-warfare. Rebuilt and reformed by the Adeptus Mars and by extension Cult Mechanicus to serve the Imperium. These weapon platforms are venerated by the Mechanicum as avatars of the Machine God&apos;s power. Demonstrations of the destructive power wielded by the Omnissiah. Coming in three broad weight classes with numerous patterns to each. Designed for unique battlefield roles and purposes. The Titan Ordo&apos;s are roughly divided into Crusader and Garrison Legions. Either assigned to a military force or used to defend a crucial planet like a Forge or Fortress world.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Scout Class- </b>The comparatively lightest class of Titan. 15m at the shoulder and equipped with fast weaponry designed to inflict damage quickly. As the name suggests they are used as a vanguard for the larger Titan Legion. Locating key targets and softening up enemy resistance. Packs of Scout Titans operating as a raiding force are another standard tactic. Employing the speed and mobility of the craft with its massive firepower.<br>
<br>
Warhound Pattern- Standard issue scout pattern. Balanced performance allowing for it to fulfill any required role competently.<br>
Wolfhound Pattern- Equipped with superior weapons and mobility options at the cost of durability. Specializing in punishing any misstep by the enemy with rapidly deployed firepower above its weight class.<br>
Bloodhound Pattern- Better armored and slightly stripped down for easier repair and greater reliability. Designed for more independent missions and forward scouting operations.<br>
<br>
<b>Battle Class- </b>The main fighting force of the Titan Legions. 30-50m tall war machines capable of immense destructive potential. A single Battle Class Titan can match the firepower of an entire platoon of  Auxilia Tanks. Surprisingly mobile for their size and capable of repositioning to face new threats. Combining the firepower of an artillery emplacement with the mobility of a Walker.<br>
<br>
Warlord Pattern- Highly adaptable and modifiable pattern that is the most commonly used Battle class. Possesses extreme firepower capable of devastating all but the hardest of targets.<br>
Reaver Pattern- Lighter and faster than the Warlord. Acts as a midpoint between Scout and Battle Titans. Typically act as escort Titans to larger Battle and Capital class Titans.<br>
Sinister Pattern- Imperial Psi-Titans. Started as a sub-model of the Warlord but has been further modified into a unique and extremely dangerous weapon. Only deployed under the Emperor&apos;s orders.<br>
<br>
<b>Capital Class- </b>Walking fortresses measuring 50m at the smallest 200m at the largest. Slow and cumbersome, but with enough firepower to destroy entire armies singlehandedly. Requires a tremendous amount of resources to construct, maintain, and deploy. This cost is balanced by the fact they can single-handedly change the tide of battle through raw firepower and intimidating presence.<br>
<br>
Imperator Pattern- The firepower and durability of a fortress now mobile. Very few things other than fellow Capital Class Titans can survive a single volley of an Imperator&apos;s guns. Additionally, a small strike force of Skitarii are deployed inside the Titans leg and can join the battle at any moment.<br>
Apocalypse Pattern- Straddling the line between Ordinatus and Titan, the Apocalypse Pattern is a mobile siege-ender of unstoppable destructive force. Its name originates from the fact that it stands just below Exterminatus in terms of Imperial military sanction.<br>
Doom Pattern- A specialist pattern designed to maximize range and destructive potential. Acting as an &quot;artillery&quot; Titan of colossal magnitude. Typically equipped with weapons more commonly seen in Void warfare.<div class="sidenav-right"><a type="button" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="1513216296000--Threadmarks_Chapter One.html"></a></div></div></body></html>
