    Bad news first, some fairly serious personal stuff has taken up pretty much all my time and energy the last week or
    so. Due to this my rate of writing has slowed down and the next segment is delayed. <br />
    <br />
    Good News, that personal stuff is almost over and I should be able to get back to the grindstone by the weekend. I
    hope to have Chapter 20 pt 2 out by next week. Once we get to the Great Crusade I have a number of very interesting
    chapter ideas in the run-up to the Rangda Invasion. One, in particular, is the XII Legion arriving on a Xeno World
    that is desperately fighting off an Orkish WAAAGH. Hilarity Ensues. <br />
    <br />
    The Ullanor Crusade and Rangdan Xenocides are going to occur simultaneously in this timeline. Dividing the Imperium
    into two major warfronts (and thousands of minor ones) I want opinions if I should do one Arc then the other or have
    it mixed together. Like Chapter 26 is Orks and 27 is Rangdans then 28 is Orks again, etc. Either option has some
    interesting possibilities for me and I want to know if you all think it would get too confusing or boring depending
    on which option I do. <br />
    <br />
    Legion data is being worked on and the Silver Order is undergoing ever-increasing revisions and changes. (Having a
    hard time getting the right vibe for them) Running into a slight issue with posting Legion Bios. Some of the Legions
    will earn their names in battles or events important to the plot. So I don&apos;t really want to spoil too much in
    the Bios. Might just give very very vague data on how they got them. <br />
    <br />
    Lastly, I am gonna post the first few paragraphs of the next section as an apology for the delay and to get you all
    hyped. <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    &quot;The combined attacks of the XI and XIII Legions were making brutal headway across Luna. Sweeping away the
    forces of Chaos like a tide of fire. Port Luna and most of the surrounding habitats and subsurface zone had been
    reclaimed. Letting next phase of the Imperial Assault begin. Regiments of Solar Auxilia, Martian Knights, and a few
    of the more tame specimens of the Titan Legions had arrived. Still, the Cultists put up a vicious fight.
    Mass-Produced Daemon-Hosts and fell psi-weaponry backed by seemingly infinite hordes of maddened cultists proved a
    vicious combination.<br />
    <br />
    The Astartes who fought had survived the Gene-Blight. They were not Unharmed from it though. In purging the taint of
    Chaos from their bodies and souls they had been wounded. Organs and bone were marred and would take time to recover.
    Subconscious fears and stresses had been brought to the fore. The effects of the geneblight would have crippled
    mortals, but the Emperor&#x2019;s genius would not be bested by such foulness easily. The Legionaries fought on,
    through pain and damage. Luna would be redeemed and the enemies of Mankind would fall.<br />
    <br />
    Even with the higher than hoped casualty rate and chaotic surprised prepared by the Creed of Four phases the dual
    assault of the XI and XIII Legion would succeed. The XIII&#x2019;s number, flexibility, and adaptiveness were
    perfectly complemented by the vicious intensity of the XI Legion. Chapters of Marcus&#x2019;s Sons formed the
    frontline while companies of Kailb&#x2019;s children acted as shock-troopers. Combining their natural ferocity and
    psychic boons to overwhelm the foe. So far both Primarchs leading the surface assault had personally killed three
    Greater Neverborn or Second-Born each. Kalib lightheartedly mocked his brother that the one on top of the gate did
    not count to the tally.&quot;
