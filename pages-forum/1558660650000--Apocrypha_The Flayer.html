                First time here on SB.<br />
                Read this thread a few times and I loved the new lore that&apos;s been shown here. Such deep
                understanding of the 40k lore I only read on quality fanfiction.<br />
                <br />
                I had a question...<br />
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                What kind of negative consequences are seen in the true death of a C&apos;tan?

    Each C&apos;tan is basically a cosmic &quot;monitor&quot; A being who is the avatar of a particular fundamental
    aspect of the universe. Think Marvel Cosmic-Beings except far more esoteric and barely &quot;alive.&quot; They are
    part of the materium in a unique way. The best metaphor I can come up with is they were originally the Material
    universes immune-system/original inhabitants/cosmic avatar. So each is entwined with a part of the cosmic order in a
    very integral way. The Necrons found these entities as they migrated through the Milky Way and crammed them into
    mechanical bodies. Creating avatars of there gods, powered by the C&apos;tan that closest matched that god. The
    Flayer was the avatar of life itself actually. The messy minutia of carbon and proteins gobbling about in the
    primordial soup. Which filtered through the Necrons hilariously toxic and fucked up culture created the God of
    Flesh, hunger, and disease. <br />
    <br />
    So with the War in Heaven reaching its terrible climax the Necrons needed to know if they could kill a C&apos;tan,
    and what would the consequnces be. Being a race of living metal at this point. That always hated the weakness of
    flesh, Llandu&apos;gor ended up as the test subject. The Flayer Virus was his revenge, and why the Necrons realized
    sharding was the best way. The destruction of the Flayer permanently messed with life and sentience in general. This
    is why the 40k Universe is inherently hostile. Probability seems to actively work against life. The 40k Cosmos is
    damaged and the consequences is how ugly and brutal everything is. The Chaos Gods are parasites that feed off the
    damage and make it worse. the War in Heaven, the Death of the Flayer, in particular, kicked off the whole shebang.
