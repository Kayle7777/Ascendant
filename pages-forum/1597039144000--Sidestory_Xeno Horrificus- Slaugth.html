<b>Xeno Horrificus</b>: Slaugth ( Erv&apos;podia Vermiculus) <br>
<br>
<b>Threat Level:</b> Purgio- 7<br>
<br>
<b>Description:</b> The Slaugth are a species of Cerebervove parasite colonies. Taking the form of a mass of worm-like member specimens that operate as a unified organism. With each individual worm carrying on independent biological functions and storing some of the memories and personality of the full colony. According to Imperial Intelligence, it seems the Slaugh are not a servitor species as initially thought but a unique caste/house of the Rangda Kindred. Who for an unknown reason did not accompany the rest of its species in the forced diaspora to the Ghoul and Halo Stars. Instead of remaining behind as agents of the greater Rangda species/alliance. Being true Rangda the intellect of a Slaugh is directly proportional to the number of worms that make up a colony. With older and more powerful Slaugth no longer capable of maintaining any semblance to the human form and instead resembling a vehicle or even building-sized mass of worm-equivalents. However, most colony/individuals recorded range from 50kg-150kg in total weight. Capable of forming into a humanoid mass of worm-equivalents that can crudely mimic actions and appearances of other sapient species. This very mild shape-changing ability aids the Slaugth as infiltrators but is not a primary tool of the Xeno. The true danger of a Slaugth comes from its feeding habits. An average-sized Slaugth is fully capable of attacking and consuming an adult human over a few hours. The worm-mass envelops the Xenos prey and exposes it to the paralyzing and necrotizing secreted by the worms. The conscious but helpless prey organism is devoured piece by piece by the worms and its brain is copied into the Slaugth colony. Giving the Xeno access to the memories, skills, and knowledge of its prey until it is fully digested. A process that takes several weeks, when the memories can also be truly learned by the Xeno if it sees fit. In fact, the humanoid posture of most Slaugth is provided by its current &quot;meal&quot; acting as a skeleton for the worm colony. Recently fed Slaugth is capable of appearing to walk and move like a human when those near finishing digestion appear more like a vertical mass of writhing tissue. Additionally, Slaugth are psychic blanks. Like most newborn Rangda and do not engage in Sorcery, keeping them undetectable to Psychic detection. Slaugth are unsurprisingly naturally psychopathic like most Xenos, but are also acutely aware of the behavior and psyche of species they have fed on. Granting them insight into how to manipulate and control their targets for infiltration. Because of these factors, Slaugth often set themselves up as key elements in an infiltrated world&apos;s criminal class. Granting the Xeno accesses to resources, prey, and a steady supply of amoral denizens of its infested planet to act as intermediaries and agents. <br>
<br>
<b>Infestation Zones and Behavior</b>: The Slaugth can be found all throughout the Galactic North, infiltrated into virtually every space-faring civilization in the region. Hiding within population-dense but chaotic locations. Like human Hive Cities, Orkish Feefs, and similar. Using the complex and sinister elements of these settlements to camouflage themselves. Once one or many Slaugth &quot;individuals&quot; establish themselves in a world they set to work undermining its institutions and population. Fomenting dissent and exacerbating social or political issues. Gaining a monopoly in the planets Black Market and siphoning resources from its economy and industry. Using the species mastery of biotechnology to create pathogens or highly addictive substances that are then released into the population. The Slaugth do everything they can to weaken but not destroy the planet they occupy. Making sure to never cause full-blown collapse but keeping it as weak as it can be while still functioning. Slaugth infiltration can turn a formerly productive and united planet into a bottomless resource sink on the brink of a planetary dark age in a matter of decades. Which is exactly what the Slaugth wish. Working to fundamentally weaken any spacefaring civilization they encounter while gaining as much information and control as possible. Ensuring that if and when the greater Rangda Kindred arrives the planet is an easy conquest. When possible Slaugth will expand to new worlds as they see fit and also possess entirely Slaught ruled planets. Designed to act as resource stockpiles and fortress worlds of a greater Rangda military offensive.<br>
<br>
<b>Reproduction and Lifecycle: </b>Disturbingly the Slaugth are beings of complete asexual reproduction. With every single worm of a Slaugth colony/individual capable of being separated from its siblings and producing an entirely new Slaugth. This worm is divorced from the collective intelligence of its parent and to all but the most trained eye appears as a simple carrion eater. With enough food can experience complete mitosis creating another worm. These two new worms will be have been slightly altered by the genome of whatever they have consumed. Whiles still bound together as a new colony. Given time this infant colony will grow in size and intelligence. Until once it reaches about 50kg of mass it will be close to human intelligence. At this point, the colony undergoes a biochemical shift and the programmed desires psyche of the Slaugth species emerge. Turning the colony from a scavenging predator to a sapient organism. At this stage, a Slaugth colony will seek out other members of its species. Joining the established Slaugth hierarchy if they find them or starting a new infestation if it can not. Fully grown Slaugth with enough excess worms can split off a section of its colony as a new adult Slaugth. These controlled splittings are often done by established Slaugth seeking true allies or to reduce its mass. Truly ancient Slaugth that reach many hundreds of kilos in weight will act as leaders of a Slaugth infestation. Or be transported to the nearest world under Slaugth or Rangda control. Then acting as spawners and memory dumps for the species as a whole. To truly kill a Slaugth it must be destroyed down to the last worm. However, with sufficient losses to its colony, the intellect and memories of the Slaugth will be heavily reduced. <br>

<b>Technology:</b> Artifacts fabricated by the Slaugth are mixtures of mechanical and biological matter and processes. With organic tissue overcoming the weaknesses of silicon and steel or vice versa. Often creating Vassals that perform myriad functions. Techno-organic beings that are similar to broader Rangda technology. The subtle methods and purpose of the Slaugth is also reflected in weapons and armor crafted by them. Slaugth often appear to be covered in ragged cloaks. Which in truth are semi-organic shrouds capable of refracting light and even energy to a certain degree. Agents of the Steel Order have also learned through many ugly battles the power of Slaugth Necrotic weapons. Which produces a unique form of killing. Firing a beam of exotic radiation coupled to laser-guided entangled molecules at a target. Inducing rapid cell death in organic tissue and decoupling of weaker molecular bonds. Reducing those killed by the weapon to rapidly liquifying tissue and ash. In matters of void travel, Slaugth ships are alien biomechanical horrors that use inverted void-shields to be nearly undetectable. Slaugth will often also use vehicles and ships stolen from infiltrated species to disguise themselves. Or even stowing away on them to travel to a new world. To cross the stars the Slaugth use a form of Warp Travel that relies on the Blankness and curious biology of the Slaugth to work. However, on some conquered &quot;Feast Worlds&quot; of the Slaugth great ruined organic gate structures have been found. All destroyed by Xeno defenders before the Imperium could reach them. Experts from the Mechanicum and Adeptus Psi believe these gates are related technology to Aeldari Webway Gates, but much more primitive. Possibly showing some overlap with the similar Orkish subspace tunnels.</body></html>
