<b>Xeno Horrificus</b>: Khrave (Erv&apos;yak-Mitra)<br>
<br>
<b>Threat Level:</b> Purgio-4. (Purgio-6 if Rangda infested)<br>
<br>
<b>Infestation Zones and Behavior</b>: Primarily Migratory. Khrave have two basic patterns of behavior and infestation types. Independent Khrave who are not in direct contact with the Rangdan Kindred (Pending reclassification from Empire) will act as migratory hunters. Traveling the galaxy in small (5-50) fleets of &quot;Webships.&quot; Searching for vulnerable sentient lifeforms. Preying upon pre-industrial planets, Void-Ships and any other group of sentients they can control. Either through force or subversion. These independent Khrave will devour the claimed food-source rapidly. Reproducing and growing the migratory fleet. These fleets will split upon reaching a certain size or meeting yet unknown criteria. It is believed these independent Khrave act as scouts and expeditionary forces for the Rangda Kindred. Mapping out resources and worlds for later expansion and harvest. Khrave who are in contact with the Rangdan will behave radically different. They will show much higher levels of aggression and search for inhabited worlds. Usually, ones encountered by Khrave Fleets but too well defended or populated for migratory Khrave to handle. Khrave Fleets will assemble into much larger forces of hundreds of ships and wield Rangdan technology. These macro-fleets will use similar tactics as migratory fleets to subvert and conquer entire worlds. With populations numbering higher than 500 Million. The Khrave will then rapidly set to work turning the planet into a massive farm of sentient lifeforms. Cultivating the conquered sentients as livestock. The Khrave will then act as a mixture of agri-worker and warden for the Rangda. Producing vast quantities of organic tissue for the Rangda Collective. Highly successful Khrave Farm-Worlds (With populations of sentient livestock in excess of 10 billion) will be upgraded to Rangda breeding-worlds. With the elite Khrave selected as willing hosts for other Rangda breeds. This goal of achieving host-status seems to be the ultimate goal of the Khrave. <br>
<br>
<b>Description:</b> The Khrave are a species of cerebovoric body-stealers. Their natural form is an albino worm-like creature. Typically ranging from 10cm in length for hatchlings to 1.5 meters for elders. Khrave naturally lack sensory organs other than an advanced vibrational sense. With there true-body being predominantly a mass of neural tissue and digestive organs. With a mixture of mandibles and feeding spikes capping the worm-bodies mouth. Khrave have surprising levels of explosive speed and power. Capable of moving their invertebrate form rapidly in short bursts. Typically this is used for feeding or transferring between host bodies. While physically lacking this Xeno can claim a living body for themselves as a host. The Khrave-Worm will force itself into the body cavity of its desired host through any available orifice. Rapidly releasing a series of nerve-tendrils that will latch onto the major nerve centers of the host. Typically the spinal column for humans. The Khrave will hijack the host-bodies nervous system and start to remodel its host. Devouring large parts of its internal organs and replacing them with its own body. Effectively hollowing out the host, with its life-sustaining functions taken over by the Khrave. Typically the host consciousness dies from shock in the initial attack on the nervous system. However, some cases lasting for days or even weeks during the remodeling process is not unheard of. With its newly claimed body in full control. The Khrave will set to work using a mixture of natural biological agents, biomancy and its own technology to further alter the host body. With most Khrave spending time between rest, feeding our production, tweaking there body. With the hosts rapidly becoming almost unrecognizable as its original species. Using its new body as a form of exoskeleton the Khrave will attempt to &quot;upgrade&quot; to higher quality hosts if possible. With Ambulls, Ogryns, and similar large durable sentient species prized. Khrave are also naturally psionic, albeit too a limited degree. With raw ability comparable to a Kappa class human. However, Khrave feed in a semi-unique form among Cerebvores. Like most of there kindred they feed upon the neural tissue of sentient beings. (Adepts debate if sentients are required or preferred) Khrave feeds by extending their worm-body out of there host at rapid speeds. Thrusting feeding spikes into the skull-equivalent of prey and secreting a biological acid into the brain cavity. Then drinking the brain product. This method is not what makes the Khrave unusual. What is how they also feed psychically on their prey. Ripping pieces of the soul of the target out as it dies. This creates a tell-tale psychic imprint of Khrave activity and allows the Xeno to increase there psychic potential a fraction with each feeding. With more powerful psyker-prey providing greater increases. Unlike other Cereborves this additive effect is permanent. Where Rangdan Cerebevores can collect the psychic energy of prey and spend it in sorceric-currency. The Khrave actually increase there own psychic power with each feeding. Thankfully this process is very incremental and the most powerful Khrave encountered registered as a low Beta on the psychic scale. Anecdotal evidence suggests this process is assisted by psychological distress in the victim. Leading to Khrave displaying keenly sadistic behavior related to hunting and feeding. Research regarding this and other phenomena related Khrave use of psychological torture is undergoing. <br>
<br>
<b>Reproduction:</b> Khrave are genderless and reproduces communally. With each worm-body undergoing a hormonal shift resulting in a clutch of pseudo-zygotes being produced. Khrave will then release these pseudo-zygotes into communal cisterns. Were the egg-equivalents feed upon each other. Until a tenth of the original number remains. Using the genetics and matter of consumed pseudo-zygotes to enhance themselves. The eggs will grow and eventually hatch. Where the largest of the ensuing worms-bodies are collected and have hosts prepared. The rest are kept in the cistern, to die and degrade. Adding additional fodder to the next reproductive cycle. Khrave also play a major role in the reproductive cycle of higher-order breeds of Rangdan. With elder Khrave are selected to be infected with Rangdan viral-strains. Which will gestate inside the Khrave&apos;s host-body. Passively feeding on the Khraves meals and psychic conquests. Increasing the natural potency and warp-resistance of the Rangdan. After sufficient growth has occured the Rangdan will pass into the Khrave worm-body and infect it as well. Effectively killing the Khrave and initiating a process where worm and host fuse together. Forming a new and powerful body for the newborn Rangdan. Which will be many times more dangerous than &quot;feral&quot; Rangdan raised on random hosts in quick infection. <br>
<br>
<b>Technology: </b>The Khrave combine a mixture of psychic and mechanical technology. Only engaging in major biotechnology when in contact with the Rangda. With cyber-organic augments and adjustments common outside of Rangda influence. Khrave vessels take the shape of six-pointed stars. With each point and the center of the star a mass of Void Coral. A silicon organism that is commonly seen in Rangda Kindred construction. In between each point is a plasma-based Solar-Sail. That combines energy propulsion and ion-field technology to maneuver. Khrave ships of frigate equivalent and higher typically posses a warp-drive. Combining there natural psychic abilities, the Khrave can guide their vessels in short but accurate warp-skips. The psychically active nature of the Khrave and their feeding habits make extended jumps dangerous. Typically the Xenos prefer to Warp within 0.5 light-years of a targeted system. Then use ships Solar-Sails to glide into the system. Decreasing the risk of interception or detection. In combat, Khrave use a type of Warp-Based weapon that Imperial scholars have named &quot;Glamours.&quot;  Due to the shifting and exotic nature of the weapons. Warp-Glamours are in essence blades or projectiles produced of solidified psychic-energy. Not dissimilar to certain telekinetic and pyrokinetic techniques used by Imperial Psykers. These weapons do hold a number of abnormal properties. Including the ability to cause extreme amounts of pain to living tissue. Along with severely hampering the regenerative properties of tissue affected. Making wounds inflected by them intensely painful. As well as prone to infection, extreme bleeding, and scarring. Some Khrave weapons are also usable by non-Khrave. Like a particularly unpleasant weapon known to the Imperial Military as the Extinction-Carbine. That power itself using the malice of its wielder. To fire volleys of solidified hate. Capable of puncturing Ceramite with ease and reducing affected tissue to a mixture of warp-tumors and unhealing wounds.<div class="sidenav-right"><a type="button" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="C:\data\projects\ascendant\pages-forum\1513216296000--Threadmarks_Chapter One.html"></a></div></div></body></html>
