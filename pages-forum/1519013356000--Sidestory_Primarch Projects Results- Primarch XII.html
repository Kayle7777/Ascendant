<br>
Primarch: XII Angron<br>
<br>
Foster World: Nuceria- Civilized World where ruling elite used gladiatorial combat to placate the masses. XII was discovered by a Slaver after a failed assassination attempt on him by the Eldar. Subjected to crude Cruciamen Surgery he became a star gladiator. Eventually, lead a failed slave insurrection with his fellow gladiators. <br>
<br>
Discovery: 17th- Refused to join the Imperium and attacked Custodes and XII Legionnaires sent to negotiate. Nuceria was becoming compliant and PA8&#x2019;s taint was plain to see on both him and his gladiator comrades. They were not salvageable but XII was and his Legion would be broken if he was not.<br>
<br>
Capabilities: Extreme aggression and combat capabilities originating from the Butchers Nails turned XII into a brutally effective weapon. His legion proved exemplar shock troopers and force of mass destruction. The Cruciamen Surgery robbed XII of his Superhuman intellect and strategic capability reducing him from a general and hero to a butchers tool.<br>
<br>
Legion: World Eaters- Extremely brutal shock troops who specialized in slaughtering their enemy with extreme prejudice. Recruited from the most aggressive candidates and served originally with gruesome effectiveness. Forced into Cruciamen Surgery by XII.<br>
<br>
Heresy: Traitor-  Joined XVI in an attempt to be free and get revenge. Committed some of the worst atrocities of the war upon Ultramar along with XVIII. Was critically wounded during the so-called &#x201C;Shadow Crusade&#x201D; and was forcefully ascended to Daemonhood by XVIII.<br>
<br>
Fate: Currently acts as one of PA8&#x2019;s champions and periodically invades the Imperium only to be banished at great cost. Legion was broken into warbands by the actions of a certain Terran Marine (See Terran Traitors) XII Legion has completely fallen to PA8 and are Cruciamen-mutilated berserkers.<br>
<br>
Conclusion: Extreme Failure- Cruciamen Surgery had mutilated and broken him to the point of being more monster than man. Broke his Legion mind, body and soul. Desired to be free, but could never realize he was enslaved to his own past and weakness. Responsible for a truly colossal amount of death and destruction in his madness.</body></html>
