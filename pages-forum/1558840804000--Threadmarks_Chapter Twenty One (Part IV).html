    ><br />
    &#x201C;Why?&#x201D; Asked Rogal Maur. &#x201C;Why put the Imperium, us, and the dream of unity at risk like
    that?&#x201D;<br />
    <br />
    The holograms blinked away, replaced with a series of thaumaturgical readings. Data about the rift within Luna. To
    the Primarchs, who were all versed to some degree in such psiences a startling fact became apparent. The mammoth
    warp-rift that had powered the Lunar rebellion was much older than they thought. It was not born during the uprising
    as they assumed, but decades previously. That fact filtered into their minds and was shortly followed by other
    realizations provided. The rift had been created shortly before there birth, and its creation had released a surge
    of energy. Both chaotic and anathemic throughout the Solar System.<br />
    <br />
    &#x201C;Fate is a fickle and ever-shifting thing.&#x201D;: Said the Emperor quietly as his sons watched the readings
    that had been recorded so many years ago. When the Word Bearers and Legion of the Damned dueled in the artificial
    womb of his sons.<br />
    <br />
    &#x201C;Despite my best efforts, the Primordial Annihilator discovered you, my sons. Seeing the power you could
    become it sought to claim the Primarch Project for itself. By twisting the fabric of reality and sending its minion
    into my laboratory. It sought to cast you into the Warp. Where it could twist you each to their purposes. Originally
    they succeeded.&#x201D; Continued the Emperor.<br />
    <br />
    Dante and Konrad responded almost in unison. Answering the question raised by the Emperor&apos;s phrasing.
    &#x201C;That was where the rift came from. The gods attempt to change the timeline.&#x201D; To the twin seers of the
    Primarchs, the idea of shifting fate was most familiar.<br />
    <br />
    &#x201C;Yes, and they should have succeeded. Sending you all hurtling into the Warp. Where I would duel them to
    arrange your fates. Each of you would land on a world fit to forge you or break you. Despite all my power, I could
    not save you, only give you each a chance to survive.&#x201D; responded their father.<br />
    <br />
    &#x201C;Why do you speak of such possibilities as if they were fact?&#x201D; was the near frantic response of Kota.
    The idea of being cast into the Warp, separated from his family. Subject to the malice of Chaos brought a shiver to
    the XIX Primarch.<br />
    <br />
    &#x201C;Because they once were fact. In the destiny of the universe, set in place by the Four, they succeeded.
    Hundreds of years from now. Two of you would die and nine would be corrupted. Starting a rebellion that would ruin
    the Imperium and cast humanity into ten thousand years of misery. This was the fate set in stone by the
    self-proclaimed gods.&#x201D; spoke the Emperor in a somber whisper.<br />
    <br />
    &#x201C;This future was so inviolate that the minions who broke my wards and let the Four steal you all were
    corrupted Astartes. The original damned sons of the First Heretic. As ordained by the Annihilator they would prove
    their loyalty by unleashing evil. Across the fabric of existence. A million variations of this event and its
    consequences occurred. All equally possible futures that all end with the laughter of thirsting gods. Where humanity
    sacrifices all that is good and righteous in the name of ugly survival.&#x201D;<br />
    <br />
    Silence filled the chamber yet again. The idea of such a wretched fate seemed to pollute the very room. Ironically
    the often silent Tengri spoke up first: &#x201C;This chaotic rebellion kills you and sets the universe down the path
    of extinction. Horrid, but makes sense. So then what stopped the Four from succeeding?&#x201D;<br />
    <br />
    &#x201C;The God Emperor of Mankind&#x201D; was the Emperor&apos;s response.<br />
    <br />
    Visions of a broken husk upon a throne of sacrifice flickered through the Primarchs. The sight of a twisted, broken
    version of their father. Locked in eternal agony in a desperate battle to hold back the darkness. At that moment
    they understood. Information was conveyed through bursts of psionic energy. They saw the desperate hope of the
    Carrion-Lord as it sent its Legion of Fire and Souls back along the currents of time. How the Primarchs were saved
    and how a gift of knowledge and power redeemed the Emperor before he could fail.<br />
    <br />
    As the tidal wave of information crashed through the Primarchs minds the Emperor continued. &#x201C;I brought you
    all here for a few reasons. Horus&#x2019;s return is most obvious. Yet in his wrath post-resurrection he brought my
    attention to a serious problem. A lesson and gift I had thought you all possessed. This knowledge will help explain
    my choices and actions. To the naive and small minded I often seem inhumane and foolish. I am neither. In truth, it
    is the exact opposite. Possessing the wisdom of the ages. I must sometimes act in ways that seem incorrect. That is
    because I see what is, what can be and what should be. The Lunar Rebellion occurred according to my will because the
    other possibilities were worse. This grim truth and many more shall now be known to you.&#x201D;<br />
    <br />
    With those words, yet another bombardment of psychic imagery struck the Primarchs. Instead of memories and
    information, this was futures and possibilities. They saw how fate would unfold if different choices were made. How
    no matter how many wards and guards the Emperor placed around the rift, it would eventually unleash hell at the
    worst possible time. Providing the tipping point needed for chaotic victory. So the Emperor let the Gods use it as
    they pleased. Pouring resources, time and so very much energy into the Lunar Cultists. Preparing to strike the
    Imperium hard and early.<br />
    <br />
    In fact so early it shocked the Emperor. Simply because instead of taking the tactical or most efficient path of
    fate, they took the most grandiose and epic one. The &#x201C;Gods&#x201D; like all such things are lies given
    sentience. False power parasitizing everything it can. So they acted not as Generals or masterminds but as a
    storyteller. Telling the tragedy of humanities fall. How the Great Crusade failed before it could begin. If they
    waited a year they could have struck a nearly undefended Sol System, doing far more damage and only being pushed
    back by another secret of the Emperor.<br />
    <br />
    Instead, they fed the loose collection of lunatics the Four could call upon as there material &#x201C;army&#x201D;
    into the jaws of Twenty Legions. They expended colossal amounts of energy to summon Hashut and Be&#x2019;lakor. Not
    to mention the attempt to turn Horus. It all failed, spectacularly. The loss of Zamora and the Corrupted Astartes
    were the only victory for the Gods. Zamora would be avenged and even now the Emperor could detect the ripples in
    fate the Eversacrifice was setting forth. He would be a threat, but just one of many to be crushed.<br />
    <br />
    The unworthy Astartes had been culled. Preventing the taint of their weakness from worming into the Legions. By
    letting the Moon burn and displaying the horrors of the Warp humanity had been hardened. Taught with blood and fire
    to hate the Dark Gods. To stand against those who sought to enslave or devour humanity. The Imperium would be
    founded on a bedrock of triumph. Triumph over mankind&apos;s worst foes. The Mutant, the Xeno, the Traitor and
    Worse.<br />
    <br />
    The Death of Horus was a tragedy that could only be prevented by something worse occurring. Should the Emperor have
    abandoned his duel with an unborn God to save his child? In doing so risk the death of countless trillions and
    humanity itself. He wanted nothing more to rescue his child from the Warps evil. Instead, he had a duty, to protect
    mankind until the last spark of life left him. So the Emperor made the same bleak calculation he had since before
    the Gyptian Pyramids were erected. Sacrifice the few to save the many.<br />
    <br />
    Yet all that could not compare to the impact the Angel had. Instead of simply threatening the Gods into shutting the
    gate totally. The Angel had let the Emperor strike a blow against the Four. In all his worse visions of possible
    futures, he had only seen the gate close out of fear. Fear of a weapon being used on it and touching the gods. The
    reality that unfolded had been far better. Instead of chasing away the Predators in the dark like so many times
    before. The Emperor had struck a blow at the circling horrors. Driving the Angel into the heart of Chaos. Scarring
    the gods, and setting the Four against each other once more. Buying the Imperium time until the Parasites could
    recover.<br />
    <br />
    The Primarchs understood now. The true fickle nature of fate, and how the Emperor dueled the Gods for mankind&apos;s
    future. Literally and figuratively. They saw the great burden resting on those ancient shoulders. How he refused to
    share it with anyone. Fearing the failure or destruction of any other who tried to assist. As each piece fell into
    place, the Twenty Sons of the Emperor experienced a great Revelation.<br />
    <br />
    The Emperor had crafted them for many reasons. For now, they would sire and lead his armies. One day they might help
    their father in something greater. Become worthy to help shoulder that burden. Twenty more lights to help push back
    the Darkness. Twenty more paragons to help guide humanity to salvation. The weight of eternity and infinity was not
    theirs to bear, yet.<br />
    <br />
    Horus understood as well, but still felt a deep pain in his heart. The Emperor loved them as any father would. He
    just could not love them above all else. The Emperor must be the father, guardian, and protector of all mankind. It
    would break the Immortal&#x2019;s heart to watch his children die. This would not stop him from letting all of them
    die. If it meant mankind survived. Something close to comfort, but far uglier soothed the XVI in these thoughts. At
    least the visions of the God-Emperor told him that if need be, his Father would spend his own life as well. Courage,
    sacrifice, duty, honor. This is what the Emperor, no, what humanity requires. Horus promised to himself that he
    would never be found wanting. He had seen what failure meant. The killing fields of Istvaan, the Siege, the horror
    of Chaos.<br />
    <br />
    With heavy hearts and adamantium will the Primarchs made vows. To serve, and protect humanity from the hungry
    Darkness. They would be the light. They would be Salvation. At that moment the Emperor&#x2019;s sons changed. No
    longer were they the untempered youths of the Imperial Palace. Now they were Primarchs. Demi-Gods born and fit to
    stride the galaxy. Bringing salvation to mankind, and doom to its enemies.<br />

    <br />
    <br />
    Sagitari-17 did not know how long he sat in the darkness. After the Anathema plucked him from Luna he had been
    locked in a box of cold metal. Silver inscriptions inlaid in his container constantly burned any tainted flesh
    touching them. Forcing the Chaos Spawn to huddle in a single corner. In the shadows, he waited. Fear and misery
    oozing through his being. The failure of the Lunar Rebellion and his subsequent punishment broke Sagitari-17. No
    longer the confident demagogue who turned Luna away from the Emperor. Now he was little more than a twitching puddle
    of meat.<br />
    <br />
    The ability to sleep had been robbed by his mutation. So he simply waited, staring into the dark with a dozen eyes.
    Each belonging to a different species and each protruding from his form at random locations. He could not even shut
    his eyes, his nerves were a jumbled burnt mess. Forcing him to stare into the shadows and confront himself. Cut off
    from the Warps power and locked in a box blessed by the Anathema. Something strange started to occur. The madness of
    chaos started to leak away. Not enough to return sanity or even remorse to the broken being. Just enough for
    Sagitari-17 to fully understand how much he had fallen. What he had become and that he had none to blame for
    himself.<br />
    <br />
    Eventually, after what felt like weeks of waiting in the black, the box moved. Or at least Sagitari-17 thought it
    did. He lacked inner-ears now. Sensing movement was rather difficult. After another period of stagency, his
    container moved. This time he was certain of it. These fits and starts of movement convinced Sagitari-17 he was
    being moved somewhere. Another stimulus soon touched his consciousness. It was light. A pure bright light that
    scalded him. His very flesh started to hiss and pop at the illumination. This was because the Light was not simple
    photons. It was the psychic feedback of the presence of the one Sagitari-17 feared above all. The Emperor of Mankind
    stood outside his container and had turned his focus to the Chaos Spawn.<br />
    <br />
    A shimmering face of golden sparks appeared in Sagitari-17&#x2019;s mind. It was horrific in its perfection. A
    golden Adonais, incarnate of order and power. It spoke into his mind and Sagitari-17 shivered at its words:<br />
    <br />
    &#x201C;I am everything you think of me as. A tyrant, monster, abomination, anti-messiah, fiend and worse. By my
    actions, trillions have died and more will. The Great Crusade will be the single largest military campaign in human
    history. It will also be the single greatest atrocity our species has committed. The weight of sins greater than any
    except the first races shall be on me. Sagitari-17 I tell you all this so you listen and understand what comes next.
    Despite all that, all my horrors and evils. I am humanity&apos;s only hope, and I am a saint in comparison to the
    beings you serve. Sagitari, you betrayed our species. Hoping to damn us all in your desire for petty boons and
    freedoms. You are like so many throughout history. Chafing at any restriction or law because it exists. Caring not
    for the consequences or understanding of why it is necessary&#x201D;<br />
    <br />
    The face started flicker and it finished its last words as the box moved one last time. &#x201C;And look where that
    has gotten you. A mutant hulk of broken flesh. Don&#x2019;t worry too much though. You still have purpose
    Sagitari-17. Humanity will learn from your sins. Your name will be recorded and hallowed like so many other myths.
    Icaros, Addin-shah, Harrold, Hutler, Druumpft, Kion and now Sagitari-17 are known as mankind&apos;s great fools. I
    must thank you for this gift of knowledge and warning.&#x201D;<br />
    <br />
    With that, the face disappeared and Sagitari-17 was left in the Dark, but not for long.<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <i
        >Location: The Great Chamber of the Senatorum Imperialis (Under Construction) <br />
        <br />
        Date: 835.M30 </i
    ><br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    At the Emperor&apos;s command, the elite of the Sol System had been gathered. Generals, Governors, Dignitaries, and
    more had come to the heart of the Imperium. The Great Chamber of the Senatorum Imperialis. An unfinished edifice to
    Imperial rule. That one day would hold the Emperors Court. For now, it had been cleared of equipment and served as
    an amphitheater for its master.<br />
    <br />
    In the center of the great structure stood the Emperor, a dazzling light on a podium of gold and adamantium.
    Floating above and a bit behind him, on a set of grav-platforms was a massive container of black metal. Iterators
    and Remembrancer scurried through the audience, hoping to catch every moment for documentation and inspiration. All
    twenty Primarchs and the Emperor&apos;s Inner circle were seated around the podium. Facing out and looking into the
    audience. A wall of superhumans separating the Emperor from his subjects.<br />
    <br />
    At the appointed time the hall quieted, hundreds of thousands silencing themselves out of respect for the Emperor.
    He had summoned them all here to teach humanity. To explain the threat of Chaos and why humanity must fight. The
    Emperor began his speech, which would echo across the ages and be known to humanity for eons to come. To each member
    of the audience, the words were different. The message filtered through perceptions of authority and power. Even so,
    the message was heard and understood.<br />
    <br />
    A terrible truth of the Cosmos was unveiled, the Neverborn. Sentient Warp-Predators feeding off insanity and
    worship. Four false-gods who sought to devour everything in their insatiable hunger for life. How the storms that
    cut apart the ancient human Empire was the result of the youngest gods birth. That the reason psykers went insane
    and unleashed evil was these monsters.<br />
    <br />
    The Emperor explained how the Four sought to enslave humanity, turn us into cattle or worse like so many other
    Xenos. Using countless examples from the Unification War he demonstrated the corruptive nature of Chaos. That
    religion gave them an opening. In a quote that would echo across eternity, the Emperor said: &#x201C;Any being that
    demands worship is undeserving of it.&#x201D;<br />
    <br />
    Continuing the Emperor spoke on the mythotype of demon and devil. How these were based on the Neverborn, just as the
    Fairfolk could be traced to the Aeldari Slavers. The enemy knows this and uses it. They want us to believe there
    invincibility and omnipotence. Like everything the Neverborn say, it is a lie or half-truth. The Four hoped to kill
    the Imperium in its cradle, dragging mankind eternally into the dark. They failed, the Legions had broken them.
    Twenty Legions of Superhumans were crafted to protect mankind from the horrors of the universe. No matter if they
    were alien, mutant or neverborn.<br />
    <br />
    The Lunar Gene-cults had fallen for the promises and power of Chaos. Like every other fool who choose Chaos, they
    had betrayed the Imperium and mankind. That is what the chosen of Chaos are. Traitors who sell themselves and their
    species to parasites and predators. The Lunar Cult hoped to feed every man, women, and child of Sol to a sentient
    evil. This enemy would show no quarter and they must give none. In facing Chaos mankind fought not just for its
    right to exist but its very soul. In ancient times the Emperor had been chosen to help protect and guide humanity.
    He was no god nor demon. Just a very old and powerful human. One who had walked the golden path of salvation and
    hoped to guide his kin along it.<br />
    <br />
    For humanity, everyone from the highest noble to the lowest serf was kin. One species, one soul. One that must unite
    together against the hungry dark. Unite in the Light or Die in the Dark. To further prove his point the Emperor
    summoned up a holo-portrait. Showing a handsome young Gene-wright of Luna. Gesturing to it he continued speaking.
    &#x201C;This was Sagitari-17, a brilliant Selenar Cultist who hoped to do great things. He and his followers
    listened to the whispers of faith and followed the self-proclaimed Gods. Unleashing the Horrors of Chaos on the
    Solar System. For this, he was rewarded by his masters. I want you all to see the blessings of Chaos.<br />
    <br />
    At that, the metal crate fell open. A scream powered by over half a million lungs was forced from the audience as
    they saw its occupant. The Chaos-Spawn Sagitari-17 hung in the air. Held in place by a force-field and inscriptions.
    The handsome portrait of what he once was orbited the creature. Providing a terrible contrast to the mass of limbs,
    organs, and other parts. Grasping out with stunted arms and peering with shrunken eyes the creature moaned in
    horror. With the screams and shock dying down the Emperor gestured to it and spoke: &#x201C;You can all feel that
    can you not? The disgust rising in your very soul. The knowledge that something cannot be. What you are feeling is
    the aura of Chaos. The Warps corruption seeping from its fallen servant. No simple gene-horror or mutant can produce
    such a thing. You all feel it, the evil that seeks to devour your soul.&#x201D;<br />
    <br />
    With a gesture, the Emperor summoned dozens of men and women from alcoves near the Podium. They ranged from mighty
    Astartes, and cold Skitarii to simple PDF Troopers. In total, the group held representatives of every military
    branch in the Imperium. As one they leveled their weapons at the Chaos Spawn. &#x201C;That evil is real, but it is
    not invincible. Far from it in fact. The Legions cast the armies of hell back into the pit. They along with the rest
    of the Imperium&apos;s might must be leveled against this foe. I ask you, every citizen of the Imperium, from now
    till the end of this Long War, to fight. Not for gods, wealth or anything so simple. Fight for survival! Fight so
    that one day your descendants may know a galaxy free from horrors! Place your faith, not in false-gods and
    false-kings. But in humanity. Stand strong and together the darkness will be pushed back! The Horrors of Old Night
    shall be no more. The Age of Strife is over. This is now the Age of the Imperium!&#x201D;<br />
    <br />
    As his words echoed around the great hall the representatives of the Imperiums might opened fire. Bolt, Las, Plasma,
    and Kinetic rounds punched into Sagitari-17. Reducing the traitor to ash. Letting his tortured soul fly screaming
    into the maw of chaos.<br />
    <br />
    With the Emperors great Proclamation and the destruction of the Chaos Spawn a great cheer erupted in the chamber.
    Any being without protected or enhanced hearing suffered damage to their ears. Thousands rose from there seats and
    gave thunderous applause. The Enemy of Man was known and nothing would stop the species from avenging a trillion
    trillion crimes.<br />
    <br />
    The Emperor let a smile cross his ancient lips and looked into the Warp. Watching as this moment provided mortar to
    build mankind&apos;s future. The easiest way to unite tribes is giving them a common enemy. He had originally hoped
    to wait until mankind was safe within the Webway before telling them the truth regarding the enemy. Too many risks
    with naive and dangerous children. The God-Emperor&apos;s experience had brought him to a different conclusion.
    Better to destroy whatever innocence was left in humanity then let its nativity ruin them all.<br />
    <br />
    The Applause eventually died down as the Soldiers took empty seats and the Chaos-Spawns remains were cleared away.
    Summoning a new holographic image the Emperor continued. This image was a stylized =][=. Cast in silver, capped with
    a Human skull on each end. &#x201C;This enemy is not a simple thing. They fight not just on the fields of battle but
    in wars of shadow and manipulation. Worming its way into our lives like the parasite it is. While the Legions and
    Auxilia may stand against the Forces of Chaos. We need guardians to battle the spread of this taint. As such I am
    announcing the formation of a new body of the Imperium. The Adeptus Umbrex will fight and die in the Shadows. So one
    day we can all live in the light. The symbol floating here will be the marker of the first child-organization of the
    Umbrex. The Silver Order. Humans selected for their skill, strength of will and inquisitive mind. Who shall battle
    the corruption of Chaos wherever it may be found.&#x201D;<br />
    <br />
    Imperceptible to all the Emperor paused for an infinitesimal moment on the words &#x201C;Inquisitive Mind&#x201D; He
    knew what he was creating. An inquisition to hunt his enemies. All he could hope was with his, Malcador and the
    Twins guiding hands this order might not fall to the levels of that infamous organization. It was still necessary,
    the Officio Assassinorum and a few other groups would be rolled into this Adeptus Umbrex. He could already see the
    power and threat such an organization would present. It could not be allowed to be corrupted. Drastic Measures would
    be taken. Similar to the ones already being implemented with the Astartes.<br />
    <br />
    With a few more parting words the Speech ended and the Imperium was forever changed. Warned against the darkness and
    hopefully armed against it.
