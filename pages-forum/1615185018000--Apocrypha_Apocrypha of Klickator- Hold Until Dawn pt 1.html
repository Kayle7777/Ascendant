      Location: Scylla - Imperial Auxilliary Outpost<br />
      <br />
      Date: 897.M30<br />
      <br />
      Corporal Ronnel Fendt stared out into the desert that surrounded the Imperial Militia supply base that had been
      his home for the last eleven standard months and let out yet another sigh.<br />
      <br />
      This pathetic outpost that wasn&#x2019;t even large enough to receive a proper name had to be the most boring
      posting in the entire nascent Imperium of Man. Ronnel knew he would go insane, but there weren&#x2019;t many other
      options for a young man in his position. When the Lunar Templars arrived a generation earlier, Scylla had resisted
      the Imperial Truth and fought &#x201C;to the last man&#x201D; as the former dictator of the world had declared.
      The Astartes had put the man in chains, and hundreds of thousands of soldiers in the Scyllian Army met their
      bloody ends at the ends of a bolter.<br />
      <br />
      Soldiers like Ronnel&#x2019;s parents, for instance. They had been pressed into service in the last, desperate
      days of the fighting and they had never come home. With no other family, Ronnel found himself an orphan in the
      care of the new Imperial government. When he reached the age of adulthood, his options were working in the
      numerous fields on the Agri-World, working in one of the hives that processed the food those fields produced, or
      working in the Imperial Militia to guard those hives and fields. For Ronnel, it wasn&#x2019;t even a choice. At
      least in the Milita, he wouldn&#x2019;t go mad from the boredom.<br />
      <br />
      Or so he thought. Now that he was on assignment, this was probably the worst of the three options. At least
      growing or processing the food would allow him to see something that let Ronnel know that his actions had meaning.
      All he did every day was stand at attention for his pompous commanding officer and watch the shuttles rocket up
      into space before going to sleep and doing the same thing the next day.<br />
      <br />
      Shuttles like the one that he saw at that very moment, streaking across the sky much faster than he normally saw
      them travel. Probably some lord on one of the stations in orbit had demanded a luxury, vat grown meal and needed a
      particular condiment or topping delivered without delay. Typical... only a couple of hours before sundown, but
      they just had to have their special delivery.<br />
      <br />
      As the shuttle soared overhead, a missile from the nearest hive exploded upon collision with the craft, sending it
      into a tailspin that resulted in a thunderous crash a minute later. Clouds of smoke, dust, and fire rose up into
      the air, making for a display of light and sound like nothing that Ronnel had ever heard before.<br />
      <br />
      Emergency sirens that had never been used outside of irregular drills blared out into the dusky sky. The little
      outpost suddenly became a hive of activity as every single person who had an ounce of authority started barking
      orders at anyone who would listen.<br />
      <br />
      Ronnel knew this was his chance, his one and only shot at a little bit of excitement. All he had to do was sneak
      aboard one of these convoy vehicles that was getting ready to go and investigate the action. Who cared if he
      wasn&#x2019;t supposed to be on convoy duty. It&#x2019;s not like anyone would notice.<br />
      <br />
      &#x201C;Get back to your post, corporal!&#x201D; a Sergeant Attacord roared as he passed by, grabbing Ronnel by
      the back of his uniform and shoving him aside. &#x201C;We&#x2019;re checking for survivors. Hold this position
      until we return!&#x201D;<br />
      <br />
      How very fortunate for him. The first action this world had seen in a generation and it was going to pass Ronnel
      by. He&#x2019;d sit back at camp listening to vox chatter and think about how this was going to be the best story
      he could tell when he was old and spinning tall tales at a bar. Before he could even offer up a protest, the
      sergeant was in a vehicle that was currently speeding off in the direction of the smoke coming from the wreck.
      Ronnel was well and truly stuck here now, missing out on yet another adventure.<br />
      <br />
      Grumbling to himself, Ronnel went to work cleaning his lasrifle and taking quick tours around the camp. Though
      there were technically soldiers who outranked him, they were all specialists in some field or another and as long
      as Sergeant Attacord was away, he was officially the highest ranking person at this outpost. Well, besides
      Lieutenant Kisling. But that fool was from some offworld academy and was sent here because he almost washed out of
      whatever academy spit him out. Ronnel hadn&#x2019;t seen the lieutenant outside of the mess hall in weeks, and he
      didn&#x2019;t think this occasion would be any different.<br />
      <br />
      Hours passed like this, until the low roar of a land raider filled the air. The soldiers were returning, but from
      the sounds of it, they wouldn&#x2019;t be coming alone.<br />
      <br />
      Softly at first, drowned out by the roar of the land raider&#x2019;s engine initially, screams of pain and
      pleasure filled the night air. Above the din of either the engine or the screams was the unmistakable *crack* of
      bolter fire.<br />
      <br />
      &#x201C;Battle positions!&#x201D; Ronnel roared, as he scrambled to his feet. He was cursing his stupidity. He
      hadn&#x2019;t been by to check in on the techpriest in the communications hub. They should have warned him of this
      by now.<br />
      <br />
      &#x201C;Priest, why was I not notified of our forces returning?&#x201D; he asked as he barreled his way towards
      the comm center. &#x201C;What is the meaning of thi-&#x201D;<br />
      <br />
      His words caught in his throat as he rounded the corner and saw what was left of the techpriest. The thing had
      taken its plasma pistol and fired it into its head until the gun overheated. It had then tried to shove the molten
      hot barrel into what was left of its face, but the prior damage had already done too much. It lay there smoking,
      the last vestiges of life sputtering out of it in a series of beeps and gurgles.<br />
      <br />
      Ronnel didn&#x2019;t even bother to investigate. He just ran towards the front lines. He&#x2019;d seen death and
      misery before, growing up on this world it was hard not to. What really terrified him is that he didn&#x2019;t
      know there was something that could drive a creature that was half machine to the point of madness.<br />
      <br />
      The lascannons were already starting to fire as Ronnel made his way to the front of the camp. A land raider,
      followed by the convoy vehicles his sergeant had sent out, was just arriving into camp, followed by literally
      thousands of screaming people.<br />
      <br />
      They were all in various states of distress, but they all had blood running out of their eyes, ears, nose, and
      mouth. Still they came, and the screams never stopped.<br />
      <br />
      &#x201C;Push them back!&#x201D; Ronnel roared, bringing his lasrifle to bear and unloading onto the charging mass.
      &#x201C;Hold the line! Hold the line!&#x201D;<br />
      <br />
      Miraculously, they held. As quickly as they appeared, the horde left, retreating for reasons only known to them.
      Hundreds of dead littered the surrounding area, but none of them were from the Militia soldiers. That was a small
      miracle in and of itself.<br />
      <br />
      Cheers sprung up from the camp, but Ronnel didn&#x2019;t care. He needed to find the sergeant and figure out what
      was going on. Normally Ronnel couldn&#x2019;t stand the man, but his leadership was going to be sorely needed
      right now. He had a sinking feeling in his gut that this wasn&#x2019;t the last they had heard of the
      screamers.<br />
      <br />
      &#x201C;Sergeant Attacord!&#x201D; Ronnel bellowed, desperately trying to find him. &#x201C;Sergeant, where are
      you?&#x201D;<br />
      <br />
      As he yelled, hulking figures in grey armor opened the hatch of the Land Raider and began to pile out. They were
      monstrous, easily taller than the largest man Ronnel had ever seen. He&#x2019;d heard stories about people like
      this before. He&#x2019;d become quite familiar with the tales of these mountainous men.<br />
      <br />
      They were Astartes. Hulking, monstrous, and yet possessed with surprising grace. Ronnel could only remember seeing
      them once or twice in his life, when he was very young. But seeing an Astartes was not something that a person
      forgot.<br />
      <br />
      As Ronnel&#x2019;s squad approached them, he could see that they were in the process of moving bodies that did not
      survive the chase back to the camp. Most were dressed in a drab grey suit, but there was one that had the size and
      stature of a Space Marine, as well as a man dressed in a fine outfit that immediately told Ronnel he wasn&#x2019;t
      to be messed with. Well, he used to be. His body was horribly burnt and his clothes only had a passing resemblance
      to their former glory.<br />
      <br />
      His body wasn&#x2019;t even what they were focusing on. The remaining four Astartes were piling up the corpses
      haphazardly, but they were paying very special attention to some sort of figure wrapped up in a tarp that was
      covered in glowing symbols.<br />
      <br />
      &#x201C;Stop!&#x201D; one of them bellowed, leveling his bolt pistol at the approaching soldiers as his power
      sword crackled to life. &#x201C;One step further and I&#x2019;ll kill you all!&#x201D;<br />
      <br />
      Ronnel raised his hands up slowly, still advancing towards the towering figure as he spoke.<br />
      <br />
      &#x201C;I&#x2019;m Corporal Ronnel Fendt of Outpost 501.&#x201D; he stated, desperately trying to sound confident
      and self assured as he hoped he looked. &#x201C;We saw your shuttle go down, and we&#x2019;re here to
      help.&#x201D;<br />
      <br />
      &#x201C;Ave Imperator!&#x201D; he continued, pleased by his sudden flash of wisdom as he tried to convince this
      righteous servant of the Emperor to not strike him down where he stood.<br />
      <br />
      &#x201C;Enough, Belath. They came to help!&#x201D; an Astartes who was carrying the finely dressed body called
      out. &#x201C;They are here to assist, and we need as much of that as we can, brother.&#x201D;<br />
      <br />
      A noise that could only be described as a resentful sigh escaped from Belath&#x2019;s helmet. The bolt pistol was
      quickly holstered as he leaned forward and grabbed Attacord by the front of his uniform.<br />
      <br />
      &#x201C;Touch anything you&#x2019;re not supposed to, and I will put a round through your head.&#x201D; he
      grumbled as he turned away and went back to securing the area.<br />
      <br />
      &#x201C;Apologies for my brother.&#x201D; the second Astartes said, extending his hand. &#x201C;The Sword is
      always the most combative and aggressive of us, and for good reason. I am Dannos, the Shield.&#x201D;<br />
      <br />
      Ronnel had no clue what any of that meant, but he didn&#x2019;t care. Fortunately, he found Attacord a moment
      later and motioned for him to come over and help him in talking with these Astartes before they blew his head off
      because he saluted too quickly.<br />
      <br />
      The sergeant was his usual arrogant self and kept on talking about how much of an honor it was to be in the
      presence of one of the Emperor&#x2019;s Angels and all such similar nonsense. The warriors paid him no mind, as
      they went about their business securing the convoy and tasking soldiers with helping them transport the cargo from
      the vehicles to the camp.<br />
      <br />
      Oddly enough, each of the soldiers assisting them with inventory operations had to stand before Dannos, who would
      cup their face in his hands for a brief moment before declaring them &#x2018;pure&#x2019; and moving on to the
      next one. It didn&#x2019;t make any sense to Ronnel, but he figured that he wasn&#x2019;t paid nearly enough to
      try and make sense out of all of this.<br />
      <br />
      &#x201C;First taste of action, eh Fendt?&#x201D; Attacord guffawed, slapping Ronnel hard enough that the Corporal
      stumbled forward a little before regaining his balance.<br />
      <br />
      &#x201C;Yeah.&#x201D; Ronnel said, trying not to make eye contact and just keeping his eyes fixed on his boots as
      he worked. Attacord was by no means a bad sergeant, but he loved to hear himself talk, and the soldiers at Outpost
      501 had figured out long ago it was a good idea to keep your head looking at the dirt and he would eventually move
      on.<br />
      <br />
      &#x201C;Shame you didn&#x2019;t ride out with us.&#x201D; Attacord continued, oblivious to the Corporals
      discomfort as they passed by the oddly wrapped statue. &#x201C;That wreck was like nothing else I&#x2019;d ever
      seen, and the people who came after us? Strange stuff that. They seemed to be after this thing here, wonder what
      in the entire galaxy with worth this much troub-&#x201D;<br />
      <br />
      &#x201C;Ohhhhhhhh.&#x201D;<br />
      <br />
      A guttural moan came from Ronnel&#x2019;s right, but it did not sound like the cry of a wounded man. It was a
      sound of pure, unadulterated pleasure.<br />
      <br />
      Before Ronnel could act, he felt something collide with him and he saw stars as his head smack violently off the
      dirt. Blinding pain coursed through him, and white spots blotted out his vision almost entirely.<br />
      <br />
      &#x201C;She&#x2019;s beautiful, Fendt.&#x201D; a voice said, crazed out of its mind to where Ronnel almost could
      make out the speaker.<br />
      <br />
      &#x201C;Attacord?&#x201D;<br />
      <br />
      The sergeant was wrestling with him now, pinning him down and rotating him towards a direction, though Ronnel
      couldn&#x2019;t make out which. His eyes were shut tight with pain, and the ringing in his ears made it very hard
      for him to hear.<br />
      <br />
      &#x201C;I was blind, but now I see. You&#x2019;ll see too&#x2026; she is everything. She is my queen!&#x201D;<br />
      <br />
      Attacord had his head in a vice-like grip. Maddened fingers scrambled trying to find purchase on his eyelids, but
      Ronnel buried his head in the ground, unable to do more than wiggle like a worm, but he hoped it would be
      enough.<br />
      <br />
      A thunderous crack erupted right above Ronnel&#x2019;s head, and he felt something wet plop onto his head.<br />
      <br />
      &#x201C;I warned you I&#x2019;d shoot if you were looking where you weren&#x2019;t supposed to.&#x201D; came the
      rumbling tone of Belath. Just when Ronnel was about to thank his savior, he was hauled up and a power sword was
      soon at his throat.<br />
      <br />
      &#x201C;Did you look?&#x201D; Belath roared.<br />
      <br />
      Ronnel was too scared to answer. He just shook his head vigorously. The energy leaking off the sword made his skin
      tingle, and he was hoping with all his might that this wasn&#x2019;t going to be the end of him.<br />
      <br />
      &#x201C;Hmph.&#x201D; the giant said, sheathing his sword. &#x201C;You are made of sterner stuff than most on this
      planet. Perhaps you won&#x2019;t die after all.&#x201D;<br />
      <br />
      Ronnel finally let out the breath that he didn&#x2019;t even know he was holding. Tears started to well up in his
      eyes and a pit formed in his stomach as he saw what was left of Attacord&#x2019;s head spread out all over the
      sand.<br />
      <br />
      &#x201C;What is your name, soldier?&#x201D; Belath asked.<br />
      <br />
      &#x201C;R-Ronnel Fendt, Corporal.&#x201D; Ronnel squeaked.<br />
      <br />
      &#x201C;Well then Corporal Fendt, I think it&#x2019;s time we met your commanding officer.&#x201D; Belath said,
      brushing Ronnel aside as he made his way towards the camp. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s time we informed them of
      what&#x2019;s going on here, and what&#x2019;s at stake if we don&#x2019;t finish our mission.&#x201D;<br />
      <br />
      Not knowing what else to do, Ronnel just tagged along, following Belath like a dog following its master&#x2019;s
      bidding. Just a few short hours ago, Ronnel had been hoping for more action, for a chance to do something
      memorable that he could think fondly of for decades to come.<br />
      <br />
      There was an old legend on Scylla. Thousands of years ago, a great witch had ruled this entire planet, bewitching
      her enemies and torturing her subjects before finally being overthrown. Still, even as they burned her body, she
      diffused her essence into the very planet itself. Wishes had a funny way of coming true on this planet, but never
      the way that someone wanted. The Imperium had investigated the rumors, but had found nothing to them. Wishes were
      fanciful, and just a product of an imagination. That was the official Imperial stance at least, most of the locals
      knew better.<br />
      <br />
      Yet here he was, wishing for action and a story to remember. Ronnel chided himself for his stupidity. If he kept
      this up there was no way he was going to last the night.<br />
      <br />
      And something told Ronnel Fendt that the night wasn&#x2019;t done with the soldiers of Outpost 501 quite yet.
