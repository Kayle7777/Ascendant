    Another Theory I have been tooling with over the years. This may or may not be related to this story, in particular,
    the Identity of some of the other PA#&apos;s<br />
    <br />
    The Four Chaos Gods are arguably the greatest threat to known existence (we don&apos;t know how dangerous the
    &apos;Nids truly are) They were responsible for some of the greatest calamities in Galactic history, from the Age of
    Strife to the 13th Black Crusade and the Great Rift, but how do we know there are only Four? Now I know what
    you&apos;re thinking &quot;oh boy here we go about Malal&quot; but the Renegade God is not the focus of this theory.
    I theorize Malal may just be the tip of a very big and very dangerous iceberg.<br />
    <br />
    I speak of Chaos Unborn, possible Chaos gods that might be born or be in the process of being born. We know that
    Chaos gods are typically born slowly and steadily over vast periods of time and that Slaanesh is an oddity, so could
    other aspects of mortal emotions be congealing in the Warp? The reason I started thinking about this was some
    reading I was doing into Warhammer Fantasy and how Be&apos;lakor is referred to as the only Daemon Prince of Chaos
    Undivided. This seems extremely contradictory to 40k that has many Daemon Princes of Chaos Undivided, such as
    Lorgar, Perturabo and Ingethel. This could be a simple lore differentiation but I thought that it might be more.
    What if Chaos Undivided is not Undivided but Chaos Unborn. With these Daemon Princes being servants of unborn
    gods.<br />
    <br />
    The three main aspects of Chaos undivided that do not seem to fit under any other gods banner seem like good
    possibles for Unborn Chaos Gods. The first of these is what I am going to call the Dark Machine, the thing that is
    worshiped by the Dark Mechanicum, the Kai-Smiths and might be the Unborn patron of Perturabo. Second is The
    Raptor-God the entity that is Worshiped by the Raptor-Cults and may be the Chaos God of Fear, considering its
    worshipers. Lastly and most terrifying is the Unborn God of Faith, this being is the most likely result of the
    Word-bearers efforts and the countless lesser Cults across the Galaxy.<br />
    <br />
    This Unborn god might be related to what Lorgar has been up too for the last 10k years. The really scary thing is
    what if this Faith god might not just be a god of dark faiths but related to the Faith in the Emperor. What if a
    mutated Half God-Emperor half Chaos God is gestating in the Warp being fed by the blind faith of the Imperium and
    the insanity of Chaos Undivided?
