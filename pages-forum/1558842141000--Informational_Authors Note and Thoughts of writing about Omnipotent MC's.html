A.N. Well School is done and I am going on vacation next week. So I wanted to crank this out as quick as possible so you folks were not waiting too long. Here we see the first look at the Silver Order and the Primarchs getting a talking too. Next segment we will see the Silver Knights and what dear old Fabius has been cooking up. Beta is busy so probably rough around the edges. With this, I wanted to highlight the Emperor&apos;s charismatic demagoguery. He is a manipulative cold-hearted bastard. But dammit he&apos;s our manipulative cold-hearted bastard.  <br>
<br>
Hopefully, Sagitari-17&apos;s fate seems appropriate. Also, I hope the Emperor&apos;s explanation is put to rest some stuff. Still, the Chapter is not yet over and we still have a few things to cover. Like what is the Silver Order and what is with the Crap ton of Gene-Seed Big-E has stashed in his lab. I will tell you it&apos;s connected to the Silver Knights but also something else. Hope you all enjoy! <br>

Lastly, One big issue people seem to have is that the Emperor is too much/too little of a Mary Sue. Those complaints are valid but miss the fundamental issue with this type of writing. It&apos;s a Fix-fic. The characters actually learn from the mistakes of there future self and grow. The Emperor was already basically YHWH in Power Armor and then I went and got rid of a few of his big flaws. So the issue I deal with is making the story engaging and entertaining while having a Gestalt-Ubermensch with 2-3 types of precognitive knowledge running around. My ultimate goal is to sort of have the story be like a Roller Coaster. You know how its gonna go and where you end up. That does not make it any less fun. The Story is called Imperium Ascendant so y&apos;know expect the Imperium to Ascend. That journey will still have strife Also as we move into the great Crusade the Emperor will take more of a backseat. So instead of the MC he will be the settings &quot;Big-Good&quot; So hopefully the movement towards the perspective of the Primarchs, Astartes and mighty mortals will make things more interesting. If not and at this point you don&apos;t like the story and have no desire to continue. Well thank you for your time and so long and thanks for all the Fish!.
