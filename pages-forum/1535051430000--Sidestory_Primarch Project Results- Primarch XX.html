Primarch: Alpharius Omegon <br>
<br>
Foster World: *DATA CORRUPTED*<br>
<br>
Discovery: *DATA CORRUPTED*/20th: *DATA CORRUPTED*<br>
<br>
Capabilities: Masters of espionage, counterespionage, and sabotage. The XX&#x2019;s were masters of unconventional warfare and could destroy a civilization without the use of a single weapon. Possessed a psychic link between the two that helped them keep in touch with each other, and this link could be used to empower Legionaries to impersonate them. Physically less powerful than their siblings the XX&#x2019;s relied on their intellect and planning skills over martial capabilities. <br>
<br>
Legion: Alpha Legion: Heavily compartmentalized with squads trained to work as independent units. Larger than average Astartes to allow their Primarchs to mask as them. Sleeper cells of XX Legionaries present in all other legions. Stealth operations supplemented with Human auxilla operatives. When forced into open combat shock and awe tactics were favored by the XX Legion. <br>
<br>
Heresy: *DATA CORRUPTED*: Legion and Primarchs both acted in the interest of both sides of the Heresy at various points. Believed to be influenced by a Xeno organization known as the Cabal, but the truth of the matter is obscured from our sight. Tested Sol&#x2019;s defense during the battle of Pluto and eventually lost control of the Legion by the Ullanor Muster of Horus.<br>
<br>
Fate: XX-1 was executed for treachery in combat during the Battle of Pluto. XX-2 continued to &#x201C;lead&#x201D; the Alpha Legion until *DATA CORRUPTED*<br>
<br>
Conclusion: Success:  *DATA CORRUPTED*
