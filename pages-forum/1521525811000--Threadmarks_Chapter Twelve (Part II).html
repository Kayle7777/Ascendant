<br>
The Emperor entered the chamber and approached the congregation of children and Assai-Matari. Laughter and shouts streamed towards him as he watched. The Primarchs had not noticed their father yet, he cloaked himself in ancient stealth arts and psychic shadows in order to watch undetected.<br>
<br>
Sensing a slight stirring in the immaterium he glanced over at Tyric focusing his mental energies into his hand. The Emperor chuckled, it was a trick the 6th Primarch had figured out a few months ago. A novel use of the Cryokinetic psychic arts that came naturally to him. Tyric had formed a snowball in his hand and prepared to surprise his older sibling Eddard with it.<br>
<br>
Lowering his perception filter the Emperor appeared before his sons just in time to catch the 500kph ball of slush. As one 20(/1) voices let out a jubilant cry of &#x201C;Father&#x201D; The boys began to instantly jockey for his attention as they boasted accomplishments and generally acted like siblings. As they settled down the Emperor spoke to them calmly. &#x201C;My sons, in one month the Martian Expedition shall begin. Before I leave I wish to spend this month with you, to see how you have all grown and developed.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The Primarchs nodded, they had known this separation was inevitable and coming soon. They had steeled themselves for this moment and were ready. No tears were to be shed for the Primarchs may have been children but they were Primarchs and knew the Emperor&apos;s reasons and that he would return to them.<br>
<br>
The Primarchs were beyond human in many ways, including their emotions. They felt stronger purer feelings than most humans, which had contributed to the fall of the Heresy in the timeline averted. The Emperor knew not of it a side effect of there warp-touched nature or a simple quirk of the countless genes stitched into the Primarchs DNA.<br>
<br>
No matter the source the Emperor had spent many nights teaching his Sons an art that few sentients ever fully master. Equilibrium of Mind: a balancing of intellect and emotion designed to temper either extreme and strengthen the psyche of the practitioner. It was an ancient skill formed by Philosophy Cults at humanities height and often thought the evolution and perfection of countless meditative arts created throughout human history.<br>
<br>
His sons had greatly benefited from this and displayed not just intellect and strength of superhuman levels but a blossoming wisdom and temperance that would hopefully allow them to become the Paragons he, no, Humanity needed. No expense had been spared to prevent there fall and the Emperor could only hope it was enough.<br>
<br>
The Emperor continued &#x201C;I am going to be more actively involved this month, my sons intend to observe you and teach you as much as I can before the next step is taken.&#x201D; His children nodded solemnly and went about their morning with a renewed conviction to make there Father and Assai-Matrari proud, and to prove themselves worthy of the destiny set forth before them.<br>
<br>
The Primarchs finished their breakfast in relative peace, the Emperor&apos;s presence naturally reduced the amount of mischief they got into. Next, they moved onto the morning spar. They used the massive training arenas capable of modifying themselves to mimic countless environments built into the Palace.<br>
<br>
So far the young Primarchs were matching an average Hykanatoi&#x2019;s score on most training courses and a few were even starting to match and even exceed Allarus scores. The Emperor watched them from an observation deck as his Sons battled there way through an artificial Under-Hive.<br>
<br>
They were each whirling masses of fire and fury. Thousands of vat-grown monstrosities and cybernetic death-beasts died before the Primarchs. Each wielded weapons designed for adult mortals with practiced ease. The Emperor watched as Octaviar and Culain fought back to back against unending flesh-puppets that their bolters and Adrathics reduced to a thin paste. Alpharius and Omegon in turn disoriented and confused swarms of Murder-creatures into setting upon feral mutant tribes imported for these tests.<br>
<br>
These and countless other sights of skill and ferocity impressed the Emperor as he watched along with the Assai Matarai and tutors observing also. The Emperor softly said,&#x201C;I believe they are ready to have safeguards Alpha and Beta removed, my sons truly live up to humanities warrior spirit.&#x201D; Meredith Kane, Kalib&#x2019;s Matrari let out a soft chuckle. &#x201C;They already have been, this is lethal combat sire. I believe Horus lead the effort to convince the Arena-Maesters to allow it.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The Emperor raised an eyebrow at that &#x201C;Is there a reason I was not informed?&#x201D; Meredith simply responded. &#x201C;They ensured you weren&apos;t, I believe they want to impress you.&#x201D; A melodious laugh escaped the Emperor&apos;s lips. &#x201C;I am impressed, such ambition, initiative, and sense of purpose. Fine then, remove safeguard Gamma as well.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The faces of nineteen mothers flickered with fear, Mary, Phillips Matrari was the one who showed no fear but calm determination. She answered the Emperor&apos;s command in her soft melodious voice: &#x201C;They will succeed, these children born of your blood and spirit and raised by us are greater than any of us could ever have imagined. The Primarchs will face any challenge and triumph, I have faith in that.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Emperor watched her confidence infect the others and felt his lips twitch in a smile. Faith the enemy of reason, his sin, and salvation in one. Millions labored under his and Uriah&#x2019;s instruction to harness that great force for humanities benefit. To teach the Children of Terra not to put faith in god-things or Transhumans but in each other. Mary Atimah had been a great success in that quest, now she showed her reborn faith, her faith in her son and his brothers. A faith in human potential.<br>
<br>
With that safeguard Gamma was removed. The Arenas gravity doubled, its temperatures started to fluctuate wildly and new greater more horrific monsters were released to hunt and be hunted. The Emperor watched with a father&apos;s pride and a scientists fascination at what occurred. His sons were Warriors and they proved that fact over and over.<br>
<br>
Baraca barely dodged a chain blade larger than him wielded by some leftover war-thing of the Techno-Barbarians. It left a nick on his armor as he jumped out of the way. The creature was right where the XII Primarch wanted it, a Web grenade detonated in the things face trapping it between two hab-structures it had been lured to. The Titanic thing was stuck and with every struggle of cloned muscle, it became more bound. When it was fully trapped Baraca decapitated it with a single strike of his blade.<br>
<br>
Countless other displays of incredible martial skill were displayed. From Iskandar slaying a dozen War-Screamers with a single strike each. To Rogal cleaving a path straight through a Ghular pack with calm certainty. After another hour or so the morning spar was finished and the Primarchs retired to disarm and compare scores.<br>
<br>
Eventually, they made their way to the Great Library of the Palace. This ever-growing monument to knowledge was a place of study and learning where copies of trillions of texts were stored. It was also where the Primarchs were tutored in the countless intellectual pursuits necessary for there future.<br>
<br>
Today&apos;s lecture was about the Legio Astartes, the Space Marines. The Primarchs were expected to be as knowledgeable about there gene-sons as the greatest Gene-wright or Terrawatt Elder. The biology and capabilities of the Astartes were discussed in detail by the Ancient Sage of transhuman lore taken from Luna to teach his craft to the perfection of it.<br>
<br>
The Emperor simply sat in the back of the lecture hall and listened with quaint amusement. This had not been the first time he had listened to a lecture being given about his creations or accomplishments. In ages past, he would often find it an interesting pastime when he was walking in the guise of academic.<br>
<br>
The Sage started the lecture with a simple question: &#x201C;The transhumans born of your genecode are formally known as the Adeptus Astartes, a title tracing its roots to Old Terran. Space Marine is typically how the term is translated into gothic or other languages but what is the original literal meaning of this name?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Magnus piped up first: &#x201C;Adeptus has the same meaning as  Master, and Astartes means Stars so Masters of the Stars?&#x201D; The sage chuckled softly: &#x201C;a common error, young Magnus. Adept is the title of Master but Adeptus is the action. To Master, Adeptus Astartes literally means Masterers of the Stars. Much like how the Adeptus Administratum masters the imperium government and the Adeptus Astro-Telepathica master the Astronomicon and its uses.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The Sage gestured to the twenty Primarchs and spoke with a mix of reverence and hope: &#x201C;You and your Genesons were created to Master the Stars for humanity. Not as rulers or owners of the Galaxy but explorers, conquerors, and defenders of humanity. An ancient Terran writer paraphrased a religious text with this famous quote.&#x201D;: &#x201C;According to the word of God, the meek would someday inherit the earth. Someday. But God never accounted for the mighty&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Your father seeks to ensure a Galaxy where humanity can grow and prosper under their own rule and guidance, yet the galaxy is a place of many horrors that would drive humanity to extinction or worse. You and the Astartes are the answer to that conundrum. The Mighty will protect the weak while they become rightful inheritors.&#x201D;   <br>
<br>
The Sage had been a good choice the Emperor thought, he knew his theory well, let&apos;s see how he does with practical. The lecture continued as the intricacies of Geneseed were discussed. Its meta-psychic nature and biological components were discussed in detail. How it linked the Astartes on both a genetic and spiritual level to there Primarch and by extension the Emperor himself. Symptoms of Warp-taint and natural degradation were discussed. Quick overviews of the 24 gene-organs were touched on, including the bloodline specific ones.<br>
<br>
The Emperor watched as the lecture carried on until Tengri, ever the quiet one surprised the lecturer and siblings with a question: &#x201C;Why does Gene-Seed reject some applicants? Shouldn&#x2019;t all pure-strain humans be capable of the augmentations?&#x201D; The Sage simply shrugged his aged shoulders. &#x201C;It is unknown why. Possibly some genetic quirk but only certain populations of humanity are capable of undergoing the transformation.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
At that the Emperor stood up and walked into the center of the lecture hall, the Sage bowed and moved aside to allow the oldest and wisest of humanities teachers to take center stage. The Emperor remembered countless similar scenes from his history, of educating bright young minds and it brought a smile to his lips. He had forgotten how much fun it was to smile, he used to smile maybe once a decade after the Iron War, its horrors had burned much of his humanity away, now his children both living and dead had restored it to him.<br>
<br>
In a lecturers, voice practiced and refined since he had debated Socrates the Emperor began. &#x201C;You are all my children, born of my blood and soul, but not that alone. Each of you was painstakingly crafted with all my knowledge acquired over nearly Forty millennia. I used my own genome as a template but you are each unique.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
As he spoke psychic images flickered through his student&apos;s minds. Of countless hours spent within secret Gene-vaults, the painstaking work done to hybridize countless strands of DNA and imbuing said product with impossible Warp-Arts. &#x201C;Each of you carries genes taken from legendary figures from human history, along with posthuman refinements unique to each of you.<br>
<br>
*An ancient Centurion of Old Roma holds a Xeno-blade aloft*<br>
<br>
*Five thousand cavalrymen were lead by a stunningly handsome prince*<br>
<br>
*The Emperor and a grizzled General discussed strategy as Iron-Men singularity engines approached*<br>
<br>
*Justice in Black clambered between spires of primitive Hives, hunting fiends and villains*<br>

<br>
* The Wiseman lay dying in the Emperor&apos;s arms right before giving his speech&#x201C;Word of the Law&#x201D;*<br>
<br>
The visions danced through the young Primarchs minds and showed them there genetic heritage. As the memories faded the Emperor continued: &#x201C;You are not just simple clones of me and as such your lineage is only compatible with individuals matching certain psycho-genetic markers. For example, Tyrics Gene-seed is far more compatible with Humans who have spliced genes, those with wild blood are much more easily accepted by his bloodline than those without.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The Primarchs nodded and processed this knowledge, Marcus ever the clever one raised his hand and asked: &#x201C;So that&apos;s why some of our lineages have an easier time finding candidates. The Markers are more common for that type of geneseed?&#x201D; &#x201C;Correct Marcus, your lineage, in particular, is one of the more verdant ones due to your genetic heritage in the Ancient Ultramarc League.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The lesson continued with the Primarchs learning more and more about there genetics and genesons with both the Sage and the Emperor teaching. This was an overview lesson and more detail in the countless topics and intricacies of Astartes creation would be discussed eventually. After an hour or two, the lecture concluded and the Primarchs adjourned for lunch. The Emperor followed them silently and thought to himself. &#x201C;Oh, Children of Terra, your champions are coming.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The Primarchs day continued as usual with combat drills, Legion exercises with the first twenty, and more lessons. Another aspect of their education was a time when creativity was encouraged. Each of them engaged in a art or science they found particularly interesting. Some preferred more material arts like sculpting or smithing while some like Dante and surprisingly Moric preferring the spoken verse or composing music. (Much to his chagrin Dante&#x2019;s siblings often referred to his musical pieces as &#x201C;Bird Song&#x201D;)<br>
<br>
The Emperor spent the day watching and interacting with his sons. The long-dormant joy of being a parent crept deeper and deeper into the Master of Mankind&apos;s soul. Yet still shadows of worries and his eternal burden clung to him. As he watched the young Primarchs finish their evening duties and prepare to retire he whispered softly to himself &#x201C;two hundred and ten years. Hopefully enough time&#x2026;&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The month sped by faster than either the Primarchs or the Emperor could wish. Every day the Primarchs impressed there Father, through intellect, martial skill, leadership and wisdom surprising for such youths. In turn, the Emperor imparted knowledge, lessons and paternal love to them in preparation for what was to come. The day of departure grew ever closer and the Emperor found himself becoming confident in his Sons. His Children of Terra were greater than he could ever hope, now it was time for him to bring the Children of Mars into the fold.</div>
