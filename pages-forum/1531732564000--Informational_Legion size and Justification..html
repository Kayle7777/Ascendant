<html><head></head><body>I have to make the Legions bigger. The Canon 40k universe just handles numbers so damn poorly. To match up to the numbers and power of various rising human powers along with threats like the growing WAAAGHs and the Rangdans I&apos;ve got to scale them up. The Legions were not the strike force of the 41st millennia but the main battle troops. The Imperial Army was an occupation force with cannon fodder uses. The Solar Auxilla were just that Auxillia. The Legio Astartes were the main army of the Great Crusade. I am basically going to retcon it so while Astartes are one-man-armies they fight in numbers more fitting for such a massive sci-fi setting. So expect million strong Legions and battles involving hundreds of thousands of Astartes duking it out with never-ending Xeno hordes.<br>

^ A Reddit post i made explaining the math and massive size disparity in 40k.<br>

So, in summary, I am not nerfing the Astartes but simply scaling up the numbers of the conflicts to seem more galactic war than a tabletop game. Chapter 16 is coming along, the next part will hopefully be up in a few days.<br>

Edit- Currently thinking low millions for each Legions in number</body></html>
