    <br />
    <br />
    Primarch: I Lion El&apos;Jonson<br />
    <br />
    Foster World: Caliban- Death World with Feudal culture located near former Core of the Eldar Empire. Strong Military
    tradition in response to Chaos incursions. Home to possible Old One artifacts that contributed to its destruction at
    the end of the Heresy.<br />
    <br />
    Discovery: 11th- Successfully incorporated with a large number of his foster worlds Warrior-Caste into Legion.
    Almost assassinated by Warrior-Caste Hardliners early on but survived thanks to Librarius aide. <br />
    <br />
    Capabilities: Physical and mental capabilities well within upper parameters. Upbringing induced paranoid tendencies
    along with antisocial behavior. Possibly the greatest strategist of the twenty. Low Level Psychic abilities
    unlocked.<br />
    <br />
    Legion: Dark Angels- Kept the Hexagrammatron organization doctrine. Heavy inspiration taken from Caliban Warrior
    Orders. Secretive and insular.<br />
    <br />
    Heresy: Split Legion- Primarch stayed loyal along with half his legion. Numerous factors from paranoia to Xeno
    artifacts helped spur nearly half of his legion to go rogue.<br />
    <br />
    Fate: Critically wounded during Legion Civil War. Comatose and hidden within Legion Headquarters. Legion became
    obsessed with hunting down traitor elements and became increasingly secretive.<br />
    <br />
    Conclusion: Semi-Successful - Psychological damage reduced ability to cooperate and negatively affected
    Legion&apos;s loyalty. Yet proved time and again to be a capable warrior and strategist. <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    Primarch: II Tallas of Dunant<br />
    <br />
    Foster World: Best&#xE4;lla- Paradise world with minimal technology. Enjoyed peaceful trade with Xenos throughout
    Age of Strife. Lead to its destruction when continued illegal trade allowed Rangdan contamination.<br />
    <br />
    Discovery: 3rd- Slight difficulties with anti-xeno aspects of the Imperial Truth and petitioned for numerous Xeno
    species to be made protectorates throughout Great Crusade.<br />
    <br />
    Capabilities: Skilled Void Admiral and diplomat. Displayed Psychic abilities related to remote viewing and
    technopathy. Not particularly martially skilled compared to the others but capable in mid to long range
    engagements.<br />
    <br />
    Legion: Valedictors- Void and Aerial Combat specialists. More socially inclined than typical Astartes. Vast
    quantities of recruits later in the crusade had been contaminated by Murder-Mind indoctrination. Legion tore itself
    apart throughout the Rangdan Conflicts.<br />
    <br />
    Heresy: Survivors stayed loyal and operate as 13th Legion successors.<br />
    <br />
    Fate: Died with the vast majority of his Legion during the Third Rangdan Xenocide. The desire to avenge his Foster
    World and increasing psychological instability caused by possible Slaugth contamination and infiltration lead to
    eventual failure and death.<br />
    <br />
    Conclusion: Failure - Only to fall in battle during the Great Crusade. Upbringing made him too trusting and
    indecisive. Proved to the others categorically the dangers of Xenos and their influences<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    Primarch: III Fulgrim<br />
    <br />
    Foster World: Chemos- Mining World that suffered from extreme resource depletion. Unified diplomatically by III.
    Underwent artistic and cultural renaissance. Destroyed during Great Scouring.<br />
    <br />
    Discovery: 5th. No issues. Legion quickly rebuilt from pre-discovery gene-issues and accidents. Served under XVI
    during rebuilding.<br />
    <br />
    Capabilities: Martially skilled and extremely Charismatic. More than a simple warrior or general, a champion of
    civilization and the arts. One of the best duelists among them. Self-Confident to the point of egotism, insatiable
    drive for perfection.<br />
    <br />
    Legion: Emperors Children- Rigorously trained and drilled to be the perfect warriors and soldiers. Displayed
    interest and skill in the arts. Tendency to egotism and glory seeking behavior.<br />
    <br />
    Heresy: Traitor- Corrupted due to a mix of Slaaneshi exposure and gene-tweaking by a rogue apothecary. Became as
    twisted as any Eldar, if not worse. Utterly insane and little more than a hoard of addicts lead by a petulant
    monster.<br />
    <br />
    Fate: III became possessed and fused with a Keeper of Secrets and a prime servant of Slaanesh. Legion became
    servants of Slaanesh and would have died off millenia ago if not for the rogue apothecary.<br />
    <br />
    Conclusion: Externally Provoked Failure- Extreme potential to be a paragon of humanity. Chaotic corruption broke and
    reduced Primarch and Legion utterly and total. Anti-Chaotic Countermeasures must be developed.<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    Primarch: IV Perturabo<br />
    <br />
    Foster World: Olympia- Urban world of warring city states. Raised by local warlord. Severe psychological issues such
    as Paranoia, and both a superiority and inferiority complex can be traced to his upbringing and possible chaotic
    contimanination.<br />
    <br />
    Discovery: 12th Showed psychological instability from day one. Decimated his Legion upon first meeting them. Saw
    only the evils of the Imperium, not that they were necessary. <br />
    <br />
    Capabilities: Extremely Intelligent, possible the greatest mind of them all. Calculating and inventive. Viewed war
    as in equation to be solved, and to use the most efficient and brutal tactics.<br />
    <br />
    Legion: Iron Warriors - Siege Experts that create and use extreme technology to accomplish their goals. Extreme
    Paranoia and sociopathic tendencies noted, most likely side effects of near constant siege warfare and behavior of
    their Primarch.<br />
    <br />
    Heresy: Traitor- Foster World broke out into rebellion that was brutally put down by a near psychotic IV. Possible
    manipulations by XVI lead to rebellion but IV ended up joining and being one of the key leaders of the rebellion.<br />
    <br />
    Fate: Almost destroyed the VII Legion in a Great Scouring Siege. Multiple Legion strongholds still exist throughout
    the galaxy but IV along with most of the legion operate from a Daemon World within the Former Eldar capital
    sector.<br />
    <br />
    Conclusion: Failure- IV&#x2019;s psychological instability and victim complex caused the formidable talents of both
    Primarch and Legion to be squandered. Possible Chaotic taint related to the Akashic Records.<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    Primarch: V Jaghatai Khan<br />
    <br />
    Foster World: Chogoris- Feral world home to originally dueling Nomadic and City dwelling civilizations. V was raised
    by Nomads and conquered them to wage a war against the City dwellers. Strong Martial culture useful in gathering
    good recruits for the Legion<br />
    <br />
    Discovery: 15th saw the Imperium as a chance to unify humanity, but did not agree with a lot of its concepts. Had a
    distaste for Empires and Emperors of any kind and viewed the idea of them as lies.<br />
    <br />
    Capabilities: Martially and Tactically skilled, radically different tactics compared to the other legions that
    alienated some. Wiser and more mature in matters of emotion than all of the others. Honorable and courageous who
    knew his skill set and how to maximize its use.<br />
    <br />
    Legion: White Scars- Fast Assault masters who specialized in both cavalry and hit and run tactics. Rich legion
    culture that unknown to most outsiders.<br />
    <br />
    Heresy: Predominantly Loyal- Early worries about loyalty were quickly put to rest. V and his Legion were one of the
    three to fight at the Siege of Terra. Some dissenters attempted to side with XVI and V had doubts but decided the
    Imperium was the best option.<br />
    <br />
    Fate: Returned to his Foster world to find it raided by Eldar. Followed raiders into Webway and was eventually
    captured. Believed to be held somewhere in the Webway city of Port Commorragh. Legion still serves with exemplary
    track record. <br />
    <br />
    Conclusion: Successful- Proved to be one of the most psychologically stable of the Primarch. Chose to stay loyal to
    the Imperium in order to do what was best for Humanity.<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    Primarch: VI Leman Russ<br />
    <br />
    Foster World: Fenris- Extreme Deathworld with Mega-fauna descendant of both Terran Super Predators and Extragalactic
    Xenos. VI was raised by both Fenrisian wolves and indigenous humans with culture similar to M1 Scandians. <br />
    <br />
    Discovery: 2nd Slight difficulties, required to be defeated in various shows of strength. Once bested proved
    fiercely loyal and added large number of planets Warriors to growing Legion.<br />
    <br />
    Capabilities: Extremely capable warrior, possibly the martially strongest of all of them. Cunning strategist at
    times, used his reputation as a berserker and barbarian to his advantage. Possessed subconscious psychic abilities
    used to bolster his already formidable physical capabilities.<br />
    <br />
    Legion: Space Wolves/Vlka Fenryka- Brutal warriors who specializes in highly aggressive close range combat. Used a
    mix of tribal lore and Imperial technology. Sometimes considered closer to beast than man. Reliance on additional
    Gene-Modification (See Canis Helix) allowed a anti-warp Lycanthropic transformation known to them as the Wulfen.<br />
    <br />
    Heresy: Loyal- Used by XVI to push XVI into PA9&#x2019;s clutches. Fought countless battles throughout the Heresy
    and nearly died on multiple occasions. Never forgived himself for not being at the siege.<br />
    <br />
    Fate: Journeyed into the former Eldar Capital systems with inner circle to capture XV and use him to power the
    Golden Throne and Astronomicon, allowing us to heal.<br />
    <br />
    Conclusion: Semi-Successful- Displayed numerous flaws that were used by opponents to manipulate him. Extremely loyal
    and used as executioner on numerous occasions. Legion reformed post Heresy into a less bestial and more useful
    force.<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    Primarch: VII Rogal Dorn<br />
    <br />
    Foster World: Inwit- Frozen Hive World with fairly advanced technology. VII was raised by the leader of Tribe Dorn
    and eventually unified the world and the surrounding Inwit Cluster.<br />
    <br />
    Discovery: 7th No issues, Inwit Cluster successfully integrated and VII&#x2019;s flagship, a salvaged Pre-Age of
    Strife Phalanx Class War-Citadel became the mobile HQ of his legion.<br />
    <br />
    Capabilities: Extremely Loyal, and a master of siege craft. Displayed worrying masochistic tendencies based around
    the use of pain to focus and purify. Decent combatant but skilled strategist. Arguably one of the greatest Combat
    Engineers and Architects in Human History.<br />
    <br />
    Legion: Imperial Fists- Stoic Siege experts capable of building or destroying great fortresses. Void Warfare and
    Martial skill were also skillsets known to them. The greatest Astartes warrior in galactic history Sigismund was the
    1st Captain for most of the Great Crusade and Heresy.<br />
    <br />
    Heresy: Loyal- Declared The Praetorian of Terra and spent vast majority of Heresy fortifying Sol System and
    defending form low level enemy incursions. (See Battle of Pluto) Along with Malacador lead the Terra based
    Loyalists.<br />
    <br />
    Fate: Legion and Primarch almost destroyed in battle with IV and his Legion (See Iron Cage) Possible trauma related
    to our death affected performance post-Heresy. Wounded and Captured in a early Black Crusade. Stuck within the Eye
    battling champions of Chaos desperate to escape.<br />
    <br />
    Conclusion: Succesful- Paragons of Loyalty and Determination VII was the Praetorian of Terra and earned that title
    many times over. Personality flaws made him ill suited to handling some of his siblings and more delicate matters
    but useful in his specialties. <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    Primarch: VIII Konrad Curze<br />
    <br />
    Foster World: Nostromo- Hive world riddled with crime and poverty. Brutality, gangs, and insanity shaped VIII who
    raised himself on this world. His innate sense of justice was perverted by this environment, turning him into a
    serial killer who subjugated his Foster World through terror. <br />
    <br />
    Discovery: 16th His distorted precognitive sight made him see only the worst possible fates of the Imperium, despite
    this he was trained by III and took command of his legion and formed into an effective fighting force. Unfortunately
    his leaving Nostromo allowed it to revert to its earlier state.<br />
    <br />
    Capabilities: Master of terror tactics and asymmetrical warfare. Possessed Precognitive capabilities along with low
    level psychic powers. Capable of using precog in combat situations to duel considerably more powerful foes. Fear was
    his greatest weapon.<br />
    <br />
    Legion: Night Lords- Became a legion of murders and monsters thanks to Nostromon recruits. Became more interested in
    sowing terror for personal enjoyment then doing their duty. <br />
    <br />
    Heresy: Traitor- Harassed the Imperium Secundus for most of the Heresy, VIII actions lead to its collapse and IX
    making it to Terra. <br />
    <br />
    Fate: Executed by our orders, willingly gave up his life to Vindicate himself. Body claimed by Officio Assassinorum
    and used in various projects. Legion fractured into warbands and is minimally chaotically corrupted. <br />
    <br />
    Conclusion: Failure- Upbringing and lack of training to use his abilities caused severe psychological problems. Fell
    into the curse of Precognitive abilities. Believed destiny is unchangeable and his actions lead to an extremely
    negative future. <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    Primarch: IX Sanguinius<br />
    Foster World: Baal- Death World created due to Age of Strife Devastation. Home to dueling populations of Genetically
    pure humans and disaster created Mutants. IX was discovered by the pure humans and lead them to victory over the
    mutant hordes. <br />
    <br />
    Discovery: 10th. Foresaw our arrival psychically and pledged himself to the Imperium. Tribal warriors joined the
    growing IX Legion. Gene-Seed mutation eventually discovered and hide.<br />
    <br />
    Capabilities: Arguably the greatest success among the Primarchs. Peak Martial, Strategic, and Diplomatic skills.
    Charismatic and well liked virtually all. Possessed Precognitive and other psychic abilities used to further enhance
    his capabilities.<br />
    <br />
    Legion: Blood Angels- Skilled Shock Troopers who battle a Chaos born Gene-Defect designed to cripple them and there
    Primarch. Patrons of the art and known for a mix of noble countenance and surprisingly brutal martial skill. <br />
    <br />
    Heresy: Loyal- Part of the Triumvirate of Imperium Secundus but managed to make it to Terra before the Siege.
    Defended the Gates of the Imperial Palace against entire Legions worth of assaulters including Daemon Primarchs.
    <br />
    <br />
    Fate: Died facing XVI aboard his flagship during the final assault. Psychic backlash affected his sons with a new
    Gene-Curse and forcibly gave us our Humanity back for a split second. Considered a Martyr among the Imperium and his
    legion one of the finest.<br />
    <br />
    Conclusion: Extreme Success- Overcame multiple attempts by Chaos to corrupt or weaken him. Extremely Loyal and
    capable. Proof of concept for the Primarch Project, and a Paragon of human potential. Psychic Shards still active
    and useful as extensions of our will. <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    Primarch: X Ferrus Manus<br />
    <br />
    Foster World: Medusa- Feral Death world that was once a Pre-Age of Strife research center. Nomad tribes wandered the
    world trying to survive the various experiments and rogue technology loose on the world. X&#x2019;s arrival awoke
    one of the worst. A Warmachine created from reverse engineered Yngir technology. <br />
    <br />
    Discovery: 4th After slaying the Yngir Prototype he began to lead the tribes and work to advance their technology.
    When rediscovered we bested him in single combat to gain his allegiance. Tribal warriors joined his legion.<br />
    <br />
    Capabilities: Physically strong and a master smith. X prized physical and mental strength over all else. Sought to
    improve himself and the human species through technological and societal evolution. Known to be stern and blunt.<br />
    <br />
    Legion: Iron Hands- Heavily mechanized with a heavy reliance on bionic to an unhealthy level. Advanced technology
    combined with unbending discipline allowed them to gain many victories. Bionic obsession increased after X&#x2019;s
    demise and a belief that organic life is inherently weak. <br />
    <br />
    Heresy: Loyal- Killed early on at the dropsite massacre, by III his best friend. His legion was shattered and
    leaderless for most of the Heresy, unable to act serve properly due to the psychological backlash of X&#x2019;s
    death.<br />
    <br />
    Fate: Slain with his remains desecrated by both Chaos and Imperial forces. Soul unified with us and acts as leader
    of the Legion of the Damned. <br />
    <br />
    Conclusion: Semi-Successful- Very useful during the Great Crusade and helped rediscover and reinvent various
    technologies. Killed early on in the Heresy due to allowing his own emotions get the better of him. Did not reach
    his full quite considerable potential due to that error.
