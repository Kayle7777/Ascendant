<br>
<br>
The sentries looked incredibly bored as Ronnel made his approach. Clearly the &#x2018;Queen&#x2019; was able to influence their minds, but it didn&#x2019;t automatically make them smarter. He knew these men and they had never been good soldiers. All that cursed statue was able to do was remove all of their emotions and fill them with a strong desire to complete her will. <br>
<br>
As he drew closer and closer, he thought this plan might actually work. It had been easier than he thought to get what he needed. The Items required to pull off his plan were on opposite sides of the outpost and he thought he might get spotted by passing patrols, but he hadn&#x2019;t seen a single person until he drew closer to the small clearing where the statue was. They were all there, bowing to the statue or patrolling the area in case Ronnel tried to destroy their newfound object of devotion. <br>
<br>
Just before he entered their line of sight, Ronnel took a deep breath and tried to center himself. It was strange. All he could feel right now was a weird sense of calm washing over him. He knew what was about to happen, and exactly how much pain he was going to experience, but after looking deep within himself he knew that he didn&#x2019;t care. This was the right thing to do and there was a sense of peaceful finality in that sentiment. After all this time, Ronnel Fendt had finally found something greater than himself to fight for. Silently, he promised himself that if he miraculously made it out of this alive, he would never just act in his own selfish interests again. <br>
<br>
This was it. Time to get this show started. <br>
<br>
With a screeching yell, Ronnel rushed into the throng of the indoctrinated soldiers with his combat knife held high in his right hand punching wildly with his left,  and had welding goggles firmly placed around his head so that he wouldn&#x2019;t see a thing. He had made a trip to the outpost&#x2019;s armory before his suicide run, and while there had been no weapons, he found several tools. Combat flak vests, welding goggles, even a thick pair of ceramite boots meant for work in hazardous areas. Ronnel could make use of them all. <br>
<br>
Not that his initial attack made it seem that way. He&#x2019;d done a brief reconnaissance of the area and had noticed the tarp the Astartes had draped over the statue was lying at the border of the clearing. The statue was fully unveiled now, and he wasn&#x2019;t going to take a chance of looking at it. That meant attacking his former comrades blind. Literally. He got lucky once and felt the hilt of his knife sink into a torso, but he was tackled soon after and didn&#x2019;t even have time to savor his victory. They treated him roughly, punching him, kicking him, and dragging him even further into the clearing once he was subdued and no longer putting up a fight. <br>
<br>
So far so good. All according to his plan.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;That was truly pathetic, Fendt.&#x201D; Kisling said, barely containing his mirth at the situation. &#x201C;I know that Auxilia standards vary from world to world, but surely you could have done a better job than that.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Good. Kisling was monologuing. That meant he wasn&#x2019;t going to be too concerned with Ronnel&#x2019;s fidgeting. <br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2026; I couldn&#x2019;t do this any longer.&#x201D; Ronnel said, trying to sound much more tired and fatigued than he actually was. &#x201C;Thought I&#x2019;d take a few of you out with me before the end.&#x201D; <br>
<br>
&#x201C;We&#x2019;re much too good for that!&#x201D; Kisling snapped at him. &#x201C;You foolish little boy. The Queen knew you would try to attack, and we&#x2019;ve been waiting for you to appear. Now instead of dying for a False Emperor, you&#x2019;ll live for a True Queen!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Someone yanked the goggles off his face and Ronnel shut his eyes as quickly as he could. It wasn&#x2019;t time yet. He had to draw them in just a little closer. Someone else let go and he decided the best plan was to continue to fake being weak. He collapsed to the ground and lay in a fetal position, waiting for someone to pick him up.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;How hard did you hit him?&#x201D; Kisling exclaimed. &#x201C;He can barely even walk! You there, Qualt is it? Grab Fendt and take him to the Queen. I&#x2019;ll open his eyes personally.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Ronnel knew Private Qualt. He was big, muscular, and dumb as a grox. The perfect pawn for Kisling&#x2019;s schemes and in this particular case, the perfect person for Ronnel&#x2019;s plan. One idiot holding him down, and one coward to open his eyes. Neither would be prepared. <br>
<br>
Qualt picked him up and they turned slightly before walking. It was a good sign. Ronnel knew they had to be facing the direction of the Queen. Now it was just a matter of waiting. He wanted to get as close as possible because he would only get one shot at this. <br>
<br>
&#x201C;Your new life begins now, Ronnel Fendt!&#x201D; Kisling declared, and Ronnel could feel the slight shift in the air as Kisling moved in front of him. Not long now. All he had to do was wait until he moved to the side. Then it would be time. He could feel Qualt&#x2019;s grip starting to slack as he waited for Kisling to make his move and Ronnel decided to become even more limp. The more room he had when he acted, the better. <br>
<br>
&#x201C;Behold, true beauty!&#x201D; Kisling said, almost screaming into his ear as Ronnel felt the lieutenant&#x2019;s fingers beginning to touch his eyelids. This was it now or never. Ave Imperator. <br>
<br>
Quick as lightning, Ronnel slammed his ceramite clad boot into Qualt&#x2019;s toe and used the leverage to push himself up to his full height. Qualt hadn&#x2019;t been prepared for any sudden movement and Ronnel used the surprise to push off the bigger man while at the same time using the other elbow to shove Kisling out of the way. He tried to move his head as little as possible. He needed to be staring right where Kisling had him for this to work. <br>
<br>
From within his flak vest Ronnel pulled out a flash grenade left hand. It was one of the biggest they had, and it was a small miracle the vest was bulky enough to hide its frame. He threw it directly at the ground in front of him and opened his eyes for the first time since this fight began. It was weird, knowing what was in front of him was one of the very last things he was ever going to see. Ronnel always thought that it might be a loved one as he lay in bed dying at an old age. In his more macabre moments he mused that it would probably be Scylla&#x2019;s sky as he lay dying on the ground. It never crossed his mind that what he would really see was an ugly looking brown ovoid, but he mused that such a banal looking last vista was worth it for what he was trying to accomplish. <br>
<br>
With a loud bang, Ronnel&#x2019;s world went white. The size of the blast must have been large indeed, because he heard the cries of several dozen people behind him who were also caught in the blinding light. That was good. He was going to need the second or two that their surprise gave him. It was going to be hard to pull this next part off half blind. <br>
<br>
Combat gear and a flash grenade weren&#x2019;t the only things Ronnel took with him into the clearing. When he mused over his own suicide, it got him thinking about the only fireable weapon that wasn&#x2019;t in the possession of one of the indoctrinated. The techpriest had ended his own life with his plasma pistol, and when Ronnel had last checked, nobody had even gone to collect the body. His guess had been correct, and he&#x2019;d found the corpse still clutching its weapon. It was heavily damaged from its previous use, but Ronnel guessed that it was still good for a shot or two. Now he had a weapon, all that he needed was a way to get close enough to finish the job. <br>
<br>
The flash grenade had given him that chance, and now with the rest of Outpost 501 dazed and confused, Ronnel was presented with a golden opportunity. With the whiteness in his vision starting to be replaced by an encroaching blackness accompanied by a burning sensation, he knew that his time was short. <br>
<br>
Drawing the plasma pistol out from the other side of his vest, Ronnel took half a second to make sure it was ready, another half a second to take the smallest of looks at his target, and pulled the trigger. <br>
<br>
That half a second was enough to let the Queen hook her way into his mind, but it was already too late. By the time his body rebelled against his mind and yanked his arm down, the plasma bolt was sailing through the air and cut off her distinctly inhuman looking head. <br>
<br>
&#x201C;Oh no&#x2026;&#x201D; Kisling moaned, twitching on the ground as he clawed at his eyes. &#x201C;What did you do, Fendt? What did you do!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
A shriek that seemed to emanate from inside his own head tore Ronnel apart. It was the cry of a wounded apex predator feeling pain it had not felt in millennia. The sound of it was so loud that it almost drowned out the noise of the screaming coming from his own mouth. <br>
<br>
The screaming inside his mind died down quickly, and he felt the pain and the presence of the Queen withdrawing from his head almost like a splinter being extracted from flesh. It was a soothing feeling, but there was this alien sense of emptiness that he felt deep inside himself as she left. <br>
<br>
That feeling of emptiness he felt must have been amplified a hundredfold in the people around him, because they immediately started wailing and screaming for her to come back. <br>
<br>
&#x201C;She&#x2019;s gone!&#x201D; Kisling screamed, and he grabbed Ronnel by the throat and started to strangle the exhausted Sergeant. Ronnel noted with alarm that even though the lieutenant must literally have been right on top of him, he couldn&#x2019;t see a single thing besides an inky blackness that seemed to stretch out into eternity. He was well and truly blind, not that it mattered much. That too would be over soon enough. <br>
<br>
&#x201C;I can&#x2019;t feel her inside my head anymore!&#x201D; Kisling continued as he continued to squeeze. &#x201C;The fear is back! The weakness is back! I&#x2019;m empty now. I-I-I&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Without warning Kisling stopped choking Ronnel and vomited violently next to the sergeant&#x2019;s head. Ronnel thought it might have been blood, because a heavy metallic scent was suddenly in the air and it left a cloying scent that seemed to hover in the air. <br>
<br>
Kisling kept on talking, but it was nonsensical, almost as if his brain was no longer fully in command of his body. He continued to throw up blood, and as Ronnel sat up gasping for air, he thought he could hear the rest of the people in the clearing vomiting as well. It seemed as though removing the Queen&#x2019;s influence had drastic effects on the people she once held sway over. Even a brief moment of infatuation before his eyes were burned away by the grenade was enough for Ronnel to experience a headache that nearly split his brain in two and a deep sense of emotional hurt, as if the love of his life just died. He could only imagine how terrible it must have been for the rest of Outpost 501 who had suffered in her thrall for the better part of three hours. <br>
<br>
&#x201C;Kill me. Please, kill me.&#x201D; Kisling finally whimpered, and Ronnel felt the lieutenant&#x2019;s hands scrabbling for his before shoving something into the sergeant&#x2019;s hands. It was a combat knife, and the lieutenant&apos;s intentions were all too clear. <br>
<br>
&#x201C;It&#x2019;s going to be fine, Lieutenant Kisling.&#x201D; Ronnel said, fumbling his way over and clumsily stroking Kislings head as the knife snaked its way up the man&#x2019;s chest. &#x201C;Look at the sky. Find peace lieutenant, it&#x2019;s going to be fine.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
He made it quick. One sudden shove of the knife into Kisling&#x2019;s throat, one last gasp of air, and it was over. The lieutenant shuddered one last time and lay still. The rest of Outpost 501 wasn&#x2019;t as lucky. They lay dying from the trauma to their brains and Ronnel had to listen to their wailings as they died. It was miserable, but there was precious little he could do. There was no way he could find them all to give them peace, and every time he plugged his ears to shut them out, he could still hear the echoes of their cries inside his own mind. <br>
<br>
Eventually it was over, and Ronnel lay back on the ground utterly exhausted. Despite his current predicament, he couldn&#x2019;t help but let out a weak chuckle. He had won. Despite all of the odds, he had won. <br>
<br>
<i><b>I suppose it is just you and me now, Ronnel</b></i><br>
<br>
Ronnel sat upright and looked around for the source of the noise before coming to the sickening realization that it was coming from his own head. There was a horrid taste inside his mouth. Oily and metallic, but clearly of rotting flesh at the same time.<br>
<br>
<i><b>Come now, you are much too intelligent to believe a single shot could kill me</b></i><br>
<br>
The voice was soothing, charming, but if Ronnel tried, he could hear a discord in the back of his mind, hideous and antithetical to all that was orderly and human in the galaxy. <br>
<br>
<i><b>You have damaged your Queen, but I am a forgiving master. Submit to me now and all shall be forgiven. </b></i><br>
<br>
He was tempted. It was right there in front of him. All he had to do was give in to what she wanted and it would go away. All the pain, all the misery, and all the futility he felt. Just one little step into oblivion, and all his problems would disappear forever. <br>
<br>
<i><b>My servants all lie dead before me, but you shall be the first of the new. Together, we shall conquer this planet and rule it for another five thousand years. </b></i><br>
<br>
But there was another voice inside his head. It told him how her hold was weaker than before. He might not have killed the Queen, but he had most certainly damaged her. This was a request. She couldn&#x2019;t force him to obey her now. His mind was his own, and he was free to make his own decisions. This voice told him that he was still alive, and his enemy still lived. His duty was not done. There was one last thing that his Emperor, his Imperium, and his humanity required of him. <br>
<br>
<i><b>Why do you still resist? Would it not be easier to just surrender? What is it you want, my servant? Just ask it, and I shall give it to you. </b></i><br>
<br>
It took him a minute or so, but he found the plasma pistol. It screamed in protest as he charged it up, but that did not matter. He only needed it for one more shot. The head might have been a focal point for the statue, but it&#x2019;s skeleton was still undisturbed inside. <br>
<br>
<i><b>Do not do this Ronnel. You are making the biggest mistake of your life. The power of an entire world is at your fingertips. All you have to do is reach out and take it!</b></i><br>
<br>
It was slow going at first. He didn&#x2019;t know which direction she was in and his eyes were far too damaged to help. After shuffling his feet along the ground they finally connected with a base made out of stone. It was almost over now. <br>
<br>
<i><b>Not just power, I can give you a new body! A better body! Stronger, smarter, more beautiful, I can even give you your eyes back again! Look, see me one more time!</b></i><br>
<br>
And he could see, but not from his own viewpoint. He guessed the viewpoint came from Kisling, because he could see a cold, dead hand partially obscuring a point of view that looked up at Ronnel from the ground. Ronnel looked like he was almost dead himself. Bloody and bruised, with a massive burn mark surrounding a scabbed remnant of an eye looked back at him as Ronnel gazed blindly at the corpse. If the Queen thought this would tempt him, she was wrong. All it did was make it easier to know where to aim. Though it took him some time due to the awkward point of view, but Ronnel used this fell eyesight to line up his pistol perfectly with the creature&#x2019;s chest. He was happy to note that seeing it fully had no effect on him. He looked at its eldritch features and felt nothing but a mixture of revulsion and pleasure that the Emperor was going to clear the galaxy of filth like this very soon. <br>
<br>
<i><b>Are you deaf? Can you not hear me? What is the matter with you? Are you not tempted whatsoever? </b></i><br>
<br>
&#x201C;I do have one request.&#x201D; Ronnel said, as he pulled the trigger and held it back. The pistol started to hum at a dangerously high tone. <br>
<br>
<i><b>Name it, I&#x2019;ll do anything that you want me to. There must be something you&#x2019;d like from me!</b></i><br>
<br>
&#x201C;When I send you into the abyss, make sure you never come back. If you do, I&#x2019;ll be coming for you.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
<i><b>NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO</b></i><br>
<br>
The power contained inside the pistol was simply too much for the poor thing to handle and it exploded. The statue was shattered into a thousand pieces, and there was one last pitiful cry inside his head before the Queen went silent for the last time. <br>
<br>
It was over. Well and truly over. Ronnel could feel it, like some vast weight had been lifted off his shoulders that he didn&#x2019;t even know was there. Outpost 501 had been assaulted and massacred, but it had survived, even if it was survived by one mortally wounded sergeant. <br>
<br>
He was almost glad his eyesight was gone now, because he did not want to know what the remaining stump on his right arm looked like. It felt like it was on fire, and the burning plasma that he hastily tried to fling off it was probably the culprit. His hand was gone, he didn&#x2019;t need his eyesight for that, and everything hurt. Not just his arm or his eyes, but everything. His entire body was wracked with pain, and the only thing more present than the pain was an overwhelming sense of fatigue. His body knew that its mission was over. It was time to rest and there was nothing else to be done about it. <br>
<br>
Ronnel Fendt, Sergeant of the Scyllan Imperial Auxilia and last remaining member of Outpost 501, lay back and looked blindly up at the sky. A smile etched onto his face. He had gotten his wish. He&#x2019;d seen action and been the one to save the day. He just hoped that it had all been worth it in the end. <br>
<br>
&#x201C;Please.&#x201D; he whispered with the last bit of strength left in his body. He didn&#x2019;t even know who he was talking to, he just knew he needed to say this. &#x201C;I just hope as I&#x2019;m leaving this life, that I left it better than I found it.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Then Ronnel Fendt fell into a deep, restful sleep and thought no more. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Location: The <i>Aeglos </i>- Cruiser of the Lunar Templars, in stationary orbit above the Agri-World of Scylla<br>
<br>
Date: 897.M30<br>
<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Wake up Fendt.&#x201D; <br>
<br>
The voice was disrupting his sleep. Annoyed, Ronnel tried to go back into the warm embrace of slumber. He had such a terrible night. This sleep was the best thing that had ever happened to him. <br>
<br>
&#x201C;It&#x2019;s time. We need to talk.&#x201D; <br>
<br>
Whomever this was could wait. Just five more minutes was all he needed.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Open your eyes and WAKE UP!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
To Ronnel&#x2019;s great surprise, he found out that could indeed open his eyes. What&#x2019;s more, he could see. He was in some sort of bed, medical equipment was all around his and a servo skull was dutifully placing the final metal plate on his right arm. <br>
<br>
His right arm! Even more amazing, Ronnel had a right arm again, although this one was a thing of metal and electrical currents, not flesh and blood. Gingerly raised his biological left hand to his eyes, he could feel that they were things of cold metal as well. <br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yes, the surgeons of the XVI labored for weeks to give you new eyes and an arm.&#x201D; came a gruff voice. &#x201C;It appears as though you saved the day, it was the least they could do!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Belath!&#x201D; Ronnel exclaimed, trying to get to his feet before he winced and fell back to the bed.<br>
<br>
It was indeed Belath, the hulking silver-clad Astartes, wearing the dour expression that he always did. Although there seemed to be a touch more sympathy in his expression now. <br>
<br>
&#x201C;How are you here?&#x201D; Ronnel asked. &#x201C;And where are we?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I told your lieutenant I would be back with reinforcements, and that is exactly what happened.&#x201D; Belath replied. &#x201C;Although when I returned, I was in for quite the surprise. All of my brothers dead, the entire outpost killed save for one man barely clinging to life, and a corrupted statue blown into small fragments of debris. It seemed as though I had the easier time of of it than you did. As for where we are-&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I believe I can answer that, Belath.&#x201D; came a voice that entered through the door. Ronnel turned his head and saw a massive figure clad in the garb of the Lunar Templars walk through the door. Like much of his legion, he looked like a miniature version of his Primarch. It was a face that Ronnel was all too familiar with after their conquest of his home. Although unlike those previous faces, this one practically radiated with an unseen power and it set Ronnel on edge.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You are on the Imperial cruiser the <i>Aeglos</i> in service to the Lunar Templars.&#x201D; the Astartes continued. &#x201C;You have been under the care of our best apothecaries for the better part of two weeks as they mended your body while I tended to your mind. I am Corin Calistar of the XVI Legion. Ave Imperator, Auxilia.&#x201D; <br>
<br>
&#x201C;Chief Librarian,&#x201D; Belath said with a nod of his head. &#x201C;I did not know that you personally were in charge of his care.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The XVI Legion does not take kindly to Warp-tainted Xenos undoing all our hard work in liberating a planet.&#x201D; the Lunar Templar replied simply. &#x201C;My Primarch wished for this brave soldier to receive the best care possible as a way to show our gratitude for his service. There are few like him in the Imperium, and service such as his should be rewarded.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The- the Primarch knows my name?&#x201D; Ronnel asked, dazed. He had only seen Horus Lupercali once, and it was as one of millions in a packed square looking at a video of the demigod, but it was not something he would ever forget. To think that he knew of Ronnel was a humbling experience. <br>
<br>
&#x201C;Indeed.&#x201D; the librarian stated. &#x201C;And you have been given the best in mechanical replacements we could find for your arm and your eyes. See for yourself.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The hand was an excellent piece of work, the products of innovation the humble techpriests on Scylla would never have been capable of, and as a mirror was put in front of his face, Ronnel knew equal detail had been given to his new eyes. <br>
<br>
It looked like a normal eye at first glance, but the longer he looked the more he could see their mechanical nature. The sclera had a sheen to it that gave off the visage of white auramite, save his irises were a bright, piercing blue, and his pupils were holes that seemed to peer into the very void of deep space. He could see them shift and contract microscopically as his brain made instantaneous adjustments to his vision for a clarity that he had never experienced in his entire life until this point. Something told him there were even more surprises in store where his eyes were concerned, but this was not the place to inquire about such things. <br>
<br>
&#x201C;There is one last thing I am to give you, Ronnel Fendt.&#x201D; Corin Calistar stated as he moved forward and cupped the sergeant&#x2019;s face in his hands much like Dannos had. The Astartes&#x2019; eyes flashed a brilliant gold for a brief moment and Ronnel felt a sense of calm wash over him. It was not the numbing of pain like the Queen&#x2019;s had been, but the restoration of something Ronnel didn&#x2019;t even know was missing. <br>
<br>
&#x201C;There.&#x201D; the librarian said, stepping back and looking upon his work with pride. &#x201C;The very last vestiges of the Queen are removed from his mind. You should take great pride, Sergeant, You resisted the Warp with a skill that an Astartes would be hard pressed to match.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Indeed.&#x201D; Belath mused, looking at Ronnel with a strange look in his eyes. &#x201C;Forgive me, Chief Librarian, but I would ask your permission to say a question.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Permission granted.&#x201D; Calistar stated, looking back and forth between Ronnel and Belath with a curious gaze. <br>
<br>
&#x201C;What is to become of Sergeant Fendt?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;A good question, and one that I have no easy answer for.&#x201D; Calistar admitted. &#x201C;His unit is wiped out, and the last vestiges of his planet&#x2019;s rebellion are being removed as we speak. There is almost no high command left on Scylla, so he is to be given a choice: lead the remnants of the planet&#x2019;s Auxilia, or join with the Imperial forces that the Lunar Templars have command over. He shall be welcome on whichever path he chooses.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Ronnel was too shocked to speak. One of the last remaining Auxilia left on Scylla? He had no idea the corruption and the devastation of the Queen had run that deep. He had been fortunate to be at such a minor outpost that the Queen hadn&#x2019;t bothered indoctrinating it until it was too late. <br>
<br>
Still, it felt odd. He was either going to be the leader he had always imagined being, or serving in one of the greatest positions in the entire Imperial armed forces. Both were dream jobs that others had killed for in the past. So why did he feel so empty inside? He had tasted true purpose in the waning moments of Outpost 501, and he had a sickening feeling that he would never get to experience it again. <br>
<br>
&#x201C;By your leave, Chief Librarian, I have another plan for Sergeant Fendt here.&#x201D; Belath said. <br>
<br>
&#x201C;Go on.&#x201D; Calistar replied, curious as to where this was going. <br>
<br>
&#x201C;The Silver Order must expand, and quickly.&#x201D; Belath said. &#x201C;Our mistakes on Scylla are clear that there are too few of us and our training is not what it must be. We need new recruits, and ones that have already tasted the bitter fruits that the conflict with the Warp bears. We need men and women like Fendt to fight this struggle with us.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The fight that Dannos spoke of?&#x201D; Ronnel asked, unable to keep quiet.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Indeed.&#x201D; Belath answered. <br>
<br>
&#x201C;Can- can I join it?&#x201D; Ronnel asked. Here it was. Here was his purpose that he had been looking for. He had experienced horrors he didn&#x2019;t think existed in the galaxy. If he were to be given a chance to let others avoid that fate, he would do whatever it took to make sure that chance became a reality. <br>
<br>
&#x201C;What do you say?&#x201D; Belath asked, looking at the Lunar Templar librarian as he did. &#x201C;Do you mind if Sergeant Fendt here is discharged from the Auxilia and becomes a Silver Agent?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I am not his keeper.&#x201D; Calistar grinned, nodding in approval. &#x201C;Who am I to deny a man his wish to fight against the Great Enemy?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
It seemed as though Scylla was still in the business of granting wishes, but now that the witch was dead there was nothing to twist a person&#x2019;s words and turn their desires sour. Ronnel had a taste of something far greater than himself. And now he was being given an opportunity to experience it fully. One chapter of his life was coming to an end, but another one was just beginning. <br>
<br>
&#x201C;If it is my choice to make, then I say yes. Wholeheartedly.&#x201D; Ronnel said with a smile. <br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well then, it seems I have a new recruit to bring back to Titan.&#x201D; Belath said, grinning for the first time that Ronnel had ever seen. &#x201C;How long does he need to fully recover.&#x201D; <br>
<br>
&#x201C;One more cycle, then he is yours.&#x201D; Corin said, smiling as well. The business had ended well on Scylla, and the XVI&#x2019;s presence was hardly needed. Humans were stronger than it appeared. Horus would be pleased. <br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well then, in one cycle you had better be boarding my craft if you want a ride.&#x201D; Belath said. &#x201C;Otherwise you&#x2019;ll be on your own. Until we meet again, Operative Fendt.&#x201D; <br>
<br>
The two Astartes left the room and Ronnel was alone with his thoughts. Operative, not Sergeant. That is what Belath had called him. It fit him well. Perhaps it was a little tight, a title to eventually grow out of, but it suited him well for where he was in life. <br>
<br>
As he gingerly rose and made his way over to an observation port, Ronnel Fendt let out a long sigh. He gazed down on Scylla for what he knew would be the last time in a very long while. <br>
<br>
He did not care. For the first time in his entire life. Ronnel Fendt was at peace. He knew his purpose, he knew that it was good, and he could hardly wait to get started.<div class="sidenav-right"><a type="button" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="1513216296000--Threadmarks_Chapter One.html"></a></div></div></body></html>
