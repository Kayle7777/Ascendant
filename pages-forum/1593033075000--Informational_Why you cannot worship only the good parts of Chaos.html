</blockquote>Ahhh the age-old question. Let&apos;s pull this apart, shall we? The Chaos Gods are Gods, as they are spiritual entities that feed on emotions and worship. Each of them is a gestalt consciousness formed from all of a certain variety of emotions.<br>
<br>
Nurgle - Is all emotions related to stasis.<br>
<br>
Tzeentch - Is all emotions related to change.<br>
<br>
Khorne - Is all emotions related to Action.<br>
<br>
Slaanesh - Is all emotions related to Experience.<br>
<br>
They are everything of that broad category, anthropomorphized into a god-like incarnate. All the good, all the bad, everything in between. But here lies the fundamental problem. Chaos is not a passive force. It is a &quot;living&quot; being that seeks to grow and spread. Which requires more sustenance. In our terms, they hunger for extreme emotions. Since they are more powerful and have a greater effect on the warp. Khorne is fed by duty and honor. But he is fed far more by rage and hatred. Each of the Chaos gods wants more and more of the stuff they are made of. They are known as the &quot;Thirsting Gods&quot; for a reason.<br>
<br>
The Chaos Gods push the galaxy to extremes. Sowing wars to create hatred, fear, despair, hope, pain, etc. Which they can then feed off of. Emotion in any extreme becomes dangerous. Love can become obsession and fickle cruelty. Hope, a delusion or an all-encompassing drive that pushes everything to the side. The Chaos Gods could feed passively on the usual balance of emotion. Its just not that nutritious. So they farm the mortal races for emotions. Driving them to extremes in order to feed and grow. Chaos is a parasitic force that wants more and more and more. It cannot and will not allow its servants to be limited. To serve Chaos is to allow extra-dimensional parasitic-gods to tweak your body and brain as they see fit. Mutation is not just external but internal. Slaanesh numbs the pleasure centers of xer followers, removes inhibition and addicts them to sensation. Nurgle shuts down discipline and self-reliance. Encouraging and forcing his followers to rot alive. Tzeentch sows seeds of paranoia and promise. Khorne grants every greater might and fury, even after the original foe is slain.<br>
<br>
You cannot worship or serve the positive aspects of Chaos for the same reason you cannot do Heroin or Meth casually. Except this drug is alive and will do everything to drive its users utterly insane. The Chaos Gods are deities that are not content nor properly sentient. All they want is to feed and continue a feedback loop of misery until the universe itself can no longer withstand the horrors unleashed. Chaos at any time could have devoted its full power to crushing the Imperium after the Emperor died. Yet it never did. Horus did his job, he turned the entire human species into a factory farm of pain and suffering. For 10,000 years they fed upon the Imperium, just as they had on Aeldari and Kinebrach before.<br>
<br>
This is also why Chaos hates and names its nemesis the Anathema. Because the Anathema is basically the incarnates of a species will to control itself and the cosmos. The Anathema is not the opposite of chaos. Not a god of order or tyranny, that is just another form of chaos. The Anathema is control. Self-control and control of the universe.<br>
