      Klickator my editor and beta reader has graced us with a short story. Which we will be getting a few more of in
      the future. Klick is helping me flesh out the universe I am creating. With doing a slice of life and side stories
      like this.<br />
      <br />
      Stellar Dragons profile is in the works, I turned 21 yesterday so writing has slowed down due to other activities.
      But I intend to have it up by Monday at the lastest.<br />
      <br />
      I know a number of you will be interested in doing Apocrypha like this and I am open to *some* pitches but please
      keep in mind a few things. I am a cantankerous control freak. Who will not hesitate to shoot down proposed pieces
      that don&apos;t fit the feel or lore of this story. Additionally, I don&apos;t have much desire to expand the
      collaboration with this project much beyond Klickator. This might change but currently, I want to keep things
      pretty tight and avoid many of the issues that can spring up form projects like that. <br />
      <br />
      So in summary, Klick is so far my one true apostle and we are not taking applications. If you really think you
      have a good side-story idea, be damn sure its good and be okay with me shooting it down. If people want to do a
      noncanonical omake thread (which might already exist without my knowledge) feel free. Just credit and link to my
      story.<br />
      <br />
      P.S. I don&apos;t want to crush anybody&apos;s writing bug and be some tyrannical shmuck. But this has been my
      baby for something like three years and I reserve the right to be protective. Additonally I have seen how poorly
      large colab things can go sideways and have not desire for that to happen. So please be understanding with my
      choices and I&apos;ll keep creating what I hope is fun and interesting content.
