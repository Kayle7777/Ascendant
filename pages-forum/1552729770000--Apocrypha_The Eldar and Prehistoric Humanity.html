</blockquote>Myths and reality rarely have 1:1 equivalency. Yet virtually every legend has some grain of truth. The ancient Eldar raided Earth for many millennia. The Fair-Folk and similar legends of bizarre humanoid&apos;s with blue/orange morality are inspired by these encounters. Some Eldar simply used Earth as a play-ground and game reserve and at best treated humans as pets or ignored them. The idea of different breeds of Fae probably originates from different parties of Eldar tourists. <br>
<br>
Humanity has long suffered from the Aeldari&apos;s fickle and varying nature. In 40k alliances with Craftworlds and Exodite worlds would often fall apart due to Dark Eldar raids. Similarly, ancient humans would have generations of contact with fairly benevolent Eldar. Ones who would do &quot;miracles&quot; or grant boons for the same reasons we play with pets or watch wildlife. Then that party would leave and fade into myth. A century or two later a new party would show up. Who match all the characteristics of the myths. But instead of being patronizingly benevolent. they would flay babies and make villages commit atrocities for their amusement. Keep in mind this is all occurring in the Paleo and Neolithic ages. The Primitive human psykers who later became the Emperor would often forcast the arrival of the Eldar and work to hide tribes. Often without them knowing they were protected. (Some of these wards and defenses used crystal and iron to anchor the spells and energy. Hence the whole Salt and Iron shtick) <br>
<br>
With the Emperor&apos;s birth and the rise of civilization the Eldar grew bored and stopped visiting Earth. This was due to the increasing depravity in the Crone Worlds, the Emperor redirecting an Orkish WAAAGH into nearby Eldar worlds, distracting them and a massive perception filter generated by everyone&apos;s favorite glorious golden overlord. A slight psychic suggestion of &quot;this place is boring and not worth our time&quot; constantly being projected from Earth was extremely effective against the Aeldari. <br>

Oh, by the way the Houses of Eldanesh and Ulthanesh have existed for the near entirety of Eldar History. They will be important to this story and the origin of certain Deities.<div class="sidenav-right"><a type="button" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="C:\data\projects\ascendant\pages-forum\1553739933000--Threadmarks_Chapter Twenty (Part IV).html"></a></div></div></body></html>
