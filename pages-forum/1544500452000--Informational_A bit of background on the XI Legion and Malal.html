</blockquote>You are pretty close to what I have in mind actually. Currently, the XI legion (Tentatively named Eldritch Knights) is shaping up to be a bizarre group of &quot;calm berserkers&quot; like the Carchadons. That wield defensive psychic powers. A legion of viciously pragmatic warriors who are designed to detect and hunt warp-taint. Destroying it with extreme prejudice. Magnus and his legion are all about having psychic power as their main weapon. The XI, by contrast, is about using as their main shield and tool. Seals, Barriers, ESP, Taint-Detecting Wards, and Kine-Shields are the main psychic skills of the XI. Magnus was built to power and control the human webway. His legion was designed to teach human psykers. Kalib and his legion were meant to guard the webway and the new psykers. Their defensive specialties would help them plug breaches in the Webway, find and eliminate Chaotic-intrusions along with keeping the growing psychic population safe from the never born. (while eliminating the corrupted)<br>
<br>
This is why Chaos utterly screwed over XI and its Primarch. This legion was arguably as important as the XV while lacking the weaknesses that allowed the Gods to corrupt the Thousand Sons. When they paradox-napped the Primarchs they mutated and drove the XI Primarch as insane as they could. The Anathema&apos;s defenses protected Canon!Kalib from the worst of it so they dumped him on a semi-possessed and utterly tainted space-hulk. That basically did the trick. Kalib is the hunter Primarch and they used that aspect to twist his sons and him into human-hunters. Chaos works by mutating something into its worse possible form. Hunting for survival and to defend the tribe becomes HUMAN HUNTING CANNIBALISTIC TROPHY TAKERS! Kalib&apos;s insanity and hatred for the Warp drove him away from his brothers and father. He could sense their warp-born nature and could not get the desire to EAT them out of his head. For the Emperor designed him to hunt the creatures of the warp and the Chaos Gods twisted him hunger for sentient flesh.<br>
<br>
Eventually, the Legion fell. The hunger became too great and these Transhuman-Wendigos started cannibalizing entire planets. Literally consuming or kidnapping for rations every human being on entire worlds. Big-E and the Imperium eventually found out when the Administration noticed an abnormally high number of fallen-worlds discovered by the 1,111 Expedition Fleet. At first, they wondered if an unknown Xeno-Menace was scouring the human worlds of the region of space they were exploring. Inquiries were sent and the mortals of the Fleet in an attempt to save themselves from becoming snacks sent a frantic message conveying all that occurred to the Imperium through their Astropaths. Before the Imperial Inquiry, the civilians and mortal forces of the 1,111 Expedition Fleet believed the Imperium had abandoned them. The horrors of the XI Legion and their Primarch became known the Imperium. An execution force lead by Leman Russ and Valdor hunted the foul-hunters down. Custodes, Space Wolfs and Pariahs did grisly work. Depleted by the Rangdan Xenocides Russ was forced to call for reinforcements. The closest Legion was the Word Bearers. The Sons of Lorgar formed the anvil, the Sons of Russ the hammer. With the Talons of the Emperor striking critical points.<br>
<br>
Russ butchered his way through hundreds of mutant Astartes and their Ghoul-slaves. Closing in on the XI Legion the increasingly disturbed Primarch Kalib planned to hunt bigger prey. The hunger inside of him was growing and it would only be sated by hunting the Immateriums greatest quarry. Rsources that could have been used to turn the extermination into a grisly siege were redirected to a ritual of horrid power. Kalib wanted to ascend into the Warp and hunt the Chaos Gods. The Legions got closer and closer and finally cornered the XI and its Primarch on a foul world of unspeakable ancestry. Tracing back to the War in Heaven. A ritual of cannibalistic ascension was underway. In the final showdown, Lorgar was heavily wounded and Russ was forced to abandon the fight to save his brother. This bought the XI-Primarch enough time to complete the ritual. Kalib drank the warps essence and became a nightmarish abomination of Anathema and Chaos. The Primarch was Reborn as Malice: God of Anarchy, Fear and Self-Destruction. The ritual destroyed Kalib and birthed a god that sought to cannibalize its kin. Malice/Malal (as its few worshippers call it) is not the Primarch, he birthed it and provided its spark of creation but it is not him. Now this god hides within the Warp. Malice is strengthened by the Great Game itself, not a participant but a scavenger who feeds on the self-destructive nature of Chaos. Growing ever stronger in the Warps wilderness, preparing to devour everything.<br>
<br>
With their Primarch consumed in the ritual the XI Legion was easily hunted down and slaughtered by the Rout and Word Bearers. The Word Bearers re-earned their title of iconclasts with leading thep urge of all records of XI and his Legion. Only a few hundred Sons of Kalib survived in the galaxies outer reaches. Eventually, after the Heresy, they returned to the Imperium seeking penance. The Inquistion gave them that opportunity by adding them to the Astartes Praeses project. The details of their origin were either lost or never recorded. Unfortunately being placed next to the Eye was the worst possible location for them. The call of Malice could be felt far to plainly. With each generation, they succumbed to it a bit more. The desire for Redemption became a hunger for vengeance against Chaos. The hunger for vengeance became far to literal and the god born of their Gene-Father pulled them into its grasp.<div class="sidenav-right"><a type="button" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="C:\data\projects\ascendant\pages-edited\1513216296000--Threadmarks_Chapter One.html"></a></div></div></body></html>
