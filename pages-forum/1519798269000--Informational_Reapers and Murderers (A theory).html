Something that never seemed to make sense about the Nightbringers story is how a being that is anathema to the Immaterium would have such a massive effect on it. Creating a warp-concept of the Grim-Reaper and instilling an irrational fear of death in sentients seems outside of the capabilities of C&apos;tan. It would be like the Chaos Gods altering the laws of physics. The Chaos Gods are masters of the Immaterium and can only influence the Material realm by injecting parts of there dimension into ours. (Possession, Warprifts, Daemon Worlds.) Similarly, the C&apos;tan lack the ability to alter the Warp and as far as we know never attempted &quot;reverse possession&quot; or something similar into the Warp (Although the Pylons and there devouring of souls/life energy might be the equivalent.) <br>
<br>
A purely material being messing with the Immaterium so species never even touched by the Old Ones developed the Idea of the Reaper seems impossible, until you remember one particular incident during the War in Heaven. Khaine and the Nightbringer duked it out with Khaine emerging victorious. During the fight, a shard of the Nightbringer was claimed/stolen/put inside by Khaine and became his Reaper Aspect. This leaves the possibility that this was less of Khaine taking a part of the Nightbringer but them exchanging something. With Khaine gaining the aspect of the Reaper and the Nightbringer interacting with the Warp in some way. With Khaine being a Warp God touched by the material and The Nightbringer being a C&apos;tan touched by the Warp. Considering what we know about Aza&apos;Gorod and his gluttonous tendencies it seems possible he did &quot;something&quot; to the Warp (possibly an attack on souls mid-reincarnation?) to seriously mess with it in an attempt to feed on the soul stuff of it.<br>
<br>
To add another layer to this is the Avatar of Khaine. They seem to be utterly incongruous with what we know of Eldar tech and lore. Being made of an unknown metal and seemingly existing even before the fall in some form or another. With Avatars of Khaine like the Warshard existing in places that predate his Shattering and the fall by thousands if not millions of years. What if a metaphorical concept was not the only thing taken from the Nightbringer but an actual shard of his necrodermis body. Which the Ancient Eldar crafted into Altars of Khaine. (I mean using bits of fallen foes in religious site to Khaine is practically his whole shtick) These Altars fitting to a Wargod could probably channel a portion of his power into them much like the modern Avatars but most likely significantly stronger if the Warshard is anything to go by. Then when Khaine was broken and the Material became the hunting ground for Slaanesh his pieces fled to the only safety left, his foothold in the Material. <br>
<br>
So it seems likely that the Nightbringer was the only C&apos;tan to leave such a visceral effect on the immaterium, while the rest simply messing with the Material instead. Also, the idea that the Avatars are soul-containers crafted by the Ancient Eldar is backed up by Avatars being defeated and possessed. As seen by two particularly unlucky ones that a Keeper of Secrets and Genestealer Patriarch managed to take over. While this theory does seem like it has little to do with this story the War in Heaven is going to be majorly involved with later plot and I wanted to sort of introduce some of that.
