Chapter Seven: Shifting Fates</b><br>
Malcadors Eyes widened as the Emperor spoke, for with each word that the new Master of Mankind said thousands of psychic images filled his mind. Visions of a grim and dark future where humanity was enslaved to fear and suffering. The swirling cloud of memories and plans was transmitted to both Malcador and Valdor.<br>
<br>
A Sharp crack resounded throughout the chamber as the shaft of Valdors Spear shattered under his grip. The Custodes are calm, collected beings that have nearly perfect emotional control, Valdor: the greatest of them was seething with incandescent rage at the very idea of such failure to protect the Emperor was antithetical to his very being. Speaking quietly to his closest companion the Emperor said: &quot;This future will not occur, the knowledge I have gained will allow humanity to ascended. The Great Enemy has been thwarted.&quot;<br>
<br>
Letting out a shuddering sigh Malcador slumped a little onto his staff. In a shaky voice he asked his oldest friend and the one being he had absolute faith in &quot;What now?&quot;<br>
<br>
To the surprise of the both Sigillite and Captain-General, a smile crossed the Emperor&apos;s perfect features. Placing a hand on the nearest Gestation Capsule he gazed at the fetus growing inside. The tiny being slept half-formed yet even now small wings could be seen protruding from Primarch IX&apos;s back.<br>
<br>
Watching the being would have stood at the gates of the Imperial Palace the Emperor spoke: &quot;We are going to continue as planned, except for a few variations of course. The Great Crusade will need to be delayed slightly but with all Twenty Primarchs leading from the start, we will be well within acceptable parameters. We will reach Ullanor in time and in a much stronger position than we originally planned.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Malcador, unification is well underway and the Astronomicon is past the initial stages. Begin drafting groundwork with the Terrawat Elders for revisions on the design. Expect a much more considerable amount of Psychic backlash during the ignition and possible God-Forging possibilities related to it.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Also, arrange the subtle elimination of these individuals&quot; A shoal of data entered Malcadors mind about various problematic members of the New Imperium. From leaders of future rebellions to corrupt officials whose actions assisted the Heresy of the alternate future. Nodding solemnly the Grand-Master of Assassins prepared to carry out his duty.&quot;<br>
<br>
Turning to Constantine Valdor the Emperor touched the broken spear Valdor still held and the adamantium-auramite alloy healed. &quot;This Spear has served you well Constantine, but I believe something new is in order.&quot;<br>
<br>
Unsheathing his own blade the Emperor handed it to Valdor. Dropping to one knee the Custodes received the incredible gift. As it touched Valdors hands the blade shifted. Turning from a Golden Longsword into a shining spear. &quot;You are my Spear, and you should wield a fitting weapon for the Wars to come.&quot;<br>
<br>
Honored beyond words the Captain-General received the weapon that would eventually be known as the Apollonian Spear.<br>
<br>
As he motioned for the Custodes to stand and be at ease the Emperor spoke: &quot;I face a slight conundrum Constantine, What to do about the Prototypes?&quot;<br>
<br>
The Emperor, of course, spoke of the Thunder Legions, the brutal half-mad berzerkers that had conquered Terra in the Emperor&apos;s name yet were unsuited for the next phase of the Emperors plans. Something would be needed to be done.<br>
<br>
Valdor had regained his perfect composure and responded: &quot;My Lord, are you going to change the plans in motion to deal with them?&quot;<br>
<br>
Sighing softly The Emperor shut his eyes before speaking &quot;They have served me well, putting them down like rabid dogs is not a fate befitting those who laid the groundwork for my great plan.&quot; Thinking back to the memories he had seen, he remembered how the euthanization of the Thunder Warriors had helped push the Primarchs and their Legions into heresy and treachery<br>
<br>
The Emperor&apos;s eyes flashed open and he calmly said: &quot;Another solution must be reached, I will not allow the Bedrock of the Imperium to be the Blood of Martyrs.&quot;<br>
<br>
Leading Valdor and Malcador out of the chamber he continued to speak to both of them. &quot;They will continue to die off but after their final battle, they will not be purged. Other uses will be found. Ensure Arik Taranis survives that battle. I have plans for the Lighting-Bearer to-be.&quot;<br>
<br>
After giving a few additional orders to his Right Hand and Spear the Emperor was confident the Unification Wars would be finished without any more direct intervention. Now the two far more delicate tasks to tend to personally.<br>
<br>
The Conclusion of the Primarch Project, and the Astronomicon. The First would be the more difficult of the two. Altering there genomes this late in the project could spell disastrous results. Yet he knew the risks were well worth the rewards.<br>
<br>
Months past as the last battle of Terra raged and The Emperor worked tirelessly. Even the greatest of the Luna Gene-Smiths who assisted him barely understood the esoteric methods being used. Science and Sorcery beyond anything ever seen in the galaxy were wielded in perfect tandem. The Primarchs were slowly being reforged on both the physical and spiritual level.<br>
<br>
All twenty infant primarchs had their minds, bodies and genetic legacies enhanced. III&apos;s Geneseeds neurological issues caused by its extreme purity was cured. VIII and XIX had there geneseed rebuilt from the ground up to fix its deficiencies. XVIII and XIX had their malfunctioning Melanchromic Organs repaired and VI&apos;s reliance on additional Genetic modification was lessened.<br>
<br>
These and countless other changes were being made to the infants who slumbered inside there artificial womb. Including two that affected all of them, and hopefully be the masterstroke to prevent there fall into heresy.<br>
<br>
First, the maturation enhancers had been removed, the Primarchs would grow at the rate of normal human children. The additional decades required would be costly to the timeline required for Humanity to survive but having the Primarchs be actual sane, healthy adults not just overgrown transhuman children would be more than worth it.<br>
<br>
The Other change that had yet to occur weighed heavily on the Emperor, it would limit them, make the already distant Transhumans even less human. He would soulbind them to him. Protect them under his psychic bastion.<br>
<br>
Yet the idea of using such a powerful and horrific ritual on them&#x2026; it left a bad taste in the Emperor&apos;s mouth. Shaking his head a deep sigh left the Emperor&apos;s lungs. Regaining his humanity had left chinks of morality and ethics in him that needed to be occansily dealt with.<br>
<br>
Moving to the center of the chamber he prepared his Psychic Might, to touch his creations and brand their souls as extensions of the Anathema. Reaching out with feelers of light he touched each Infant Primarch and prepared to enact the ritual that would burn a mark into the Primarchs very soul.<br>
<br>
Like a Patriarch of one of the old faiths, he prepared to sacrifice his sons. Yet with both this case and that of Abraham and Isaac, an angel intervened.<br>
<br>
A faint psychic voice spoke: &quot;What are you doing father?&quot; XV was awake. The most physically powerful of the twenty asked again: &quot;What are you going to do father?&quot; The Emperor allowed his psychic corona to die down as he walked over to the infant.<br>
<br>
The being that in a certain timeline would be known as Magnus the Red peered at his creator with both psychic and natural sight. Softly the Emperor spoke to his creation. &quot;Saving you and your brothers from the darkness.&quot; Taking a deep shuddering breath he continued &quot;Forgive me, my&#x2026; my Son&quot;<br>
<br>
Just as he had declared his bond with his Twenty Creations, nay his Twenty Children the Emperor of Mankind reached out to cripple them in order to save them from the touch of Chaos.<br>
<br>
The Infant Magnus could feel the colossal psychic power surging forth and his own precognitive powers kicked in. Seeing a future where he and his brothers had their souls broken and reformed, their emotions and humanity crippled. With them being naught more than weapons instead of Humans.<br>
<br>
In a desperate psychic plea, Magnus said: &quot;Please Father, don&apos;t do this.&quot;<br>
<br>
Looking upon his children, innocent and helpless and seeing the cruel existence he was preparing to curse them with was too much. The Emperor fell to his knees. Tears streaming down his face. He could not do it. He could not do what needed to be done. The Emperor of Mankind had regained his humanity for better or worse. Stuck between two horrific options. Leaving his children unprotected from the predations of Chaos or maiming them into becoming little more than servitors in Transhuman bodies.<br>
<br>
For an unknown period of time, the Emperor knelt there agonizing between his options until inspiration struck. The Emperor had suffered through the horrors of the Age of Strife, where mankind was at its weakest and worst. When everything he had ever strived for became dust. In that age of horrors, he had forgotten the truest tenant of being human. When faced with no good options, when neither option is the lesser evil you make a third option. Realizing the existence of a third option the Emperor felt a slight bit more of his humanity come to bear.<br>
<br>
Binding his soul to the Primarchs would to irreparable harm, yet binding souls of similar power&#x2026; That would provide a measure of protection while not causing the grievous harm he feared. The Emperor had seen in the far future where bonds of loyalty and brotherhood protected all from his Angels of Death to the lowliest soldier. He was going to forge quite literal ones between his children.<br>
<br>
Turning to Magnus he reached out mentally to him and spoke<br>
<br>
&quot;There is another way my Son. Another Way to turn back the darkness.&quot;<br>
<br>
Stretching out his soul to touch each of the Primarchs he felt the shards of himself within each and every one of them. Fragments that empowered them yet not strong enough to protect them, until now that is.<br>
<br>
In a display of warp-craft unrivaled except for a few of the truly great acts of the Ancient Eldar the Emperor of Mankind linked The Primarchs souls into a great chain. An unbreakable chain of brotherhood to unite his sons against the coming Darkness.<div class="sidenav-right"><a type="button" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="C:\data\projects\ascendant\pages-edited\1513216296000--Threadmarks_Chapter One.html"></a></div></div></body></html>
