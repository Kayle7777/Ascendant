      <b>The Silver Order</b><br />

      <b>Description: </b>The Silver Order is quite simply the Imperial organization tasked with protecting mankind from
      Daemonic threats both internal and external. As one of the Orders Metallic they have been given extreme authority
      and responsibility in combating the Chaos God&apos;s influence and servants. Born from the Lunar Crusade and Chaos
      incursion into the Solar System at the Great Crusade&apos;s start, the Silver Order&apos;s duties and power are
      well known across the Imperium. However, the exact details of the Order and its activities are unknown to all but
      the most trusted servants of the Imperium. Most Imperial citizens think of the War against the Neverborn as some
      distant thing fought at the Cadian gate or on haunted worlds under the watchful eye of the XI Legion. While these
      are important fronts in the battle with Chaos, they are not the largest nor most important. The constant insidious
      corruption of Chaos worming its way into mortal souls at any sign of weakness is the true battle. Which falls to
      the Silver Order to fight. Across the Imperium the Ordo Argenteus engages in a thousand shadow campaigns of every
      manner of conflict. Marching to war alongside the Silver Knights, XI, and XV Legion. Playing games of lies,
      deceit, and entrapment against the corrupted. Traversing Daemon-infested ruins hunting for nightmarish artifacts
      of infernal power. These are just some of the ways the Silver Order fight to protect mankind. A constant war is
      hidden from plain sight to preserve the fragile faith humanity has in the Imperium. The threat of Chaos might be
      known, but the full extent and danger are well hidden. To Imperial citizens, the Neverborn and their Masters, the
      Primordial Annihilator are just another Xeno threat. A testament to the Silver Order&apos;s skill at pushing back
      the darkness. <br />
      <br />
      <b>Headquarters: </b>The Sanctorum Citadel on Titan. This hive-sized mega structure sprawls above and below
      Titan&apos;s surface. It is home to the colossal infrastructure required to support the galaxy-spanning Silver
      Order. Housing archives, barracks, training centers, laboratories, artifact vaults, and everything else required
      by the Silver Order. Its design incorporates occult wards and ritual symbolism. Combined with its ferocious weapon
      batteries and garrison of dogmatized Solar Auxilia, the Sanctorum Citadel is incredibly well defended. However,
      half of the Citadel&apos;s defenses are pointed inwards. Towards the Bright Cells of Titan. The labyrinth of
      Arcane wards and defenses winding through Titan&apos;s core and connecting to the Fortress Terminus of the Silver
      Knights. Here the Daemons and accursed artifacts captured by the Imperium are stored away. Entire legions of the
      foulest Neverborn to haunt the galaxy are locked in the Bright Cells. Each struggling for freedom, fearing the day
      the Anathema&apos;s servants find a way to truly kill them. <br />
      <br />
      <b><b>Organization: </b></b>Like the other Orders Mettalic the Silver Order is highly compartmentalized. Divided
      into Shadow Cells composed of an Imperial Agent and their support staff in the form of operatives. Every Cell
      answers to an Inspector Lord who coordinates different Shadow Cells and acts as their handlers. Inspector Lords
      are each accompanied by Astartes of the XI and XX Legion. Inspector Lords are organized into councils that oversee
      Sectors of Imperial space and other administrative zones. The highest-ranking members of the Order are the
      High-Executors. Individually selected by the Silver Lord himself, they are entrusted with the darkest secrets and
      most nightmarish responsibilities. They are mere mortals with the power to burn worlds and exterminate entire
      peoples. Entrusted with this power they face the ever-present judgment of the Emperor and the Silver Lord. The
      Silver Lord is the leader of the Ordo Argenteus as one might expect from the grim title. The nature and identity
      of this mysterious enforcer of the Emperor&apos;s will is a secret among secrets. Not even the High-Executors know
      who or what the Silver Lord is. Each seems to have their own theory. Some think it&apos;s another mask worn by
      Malcador the Sigilite, one or both of the twin Primarchs, a Perpetual of ancient pedigree, maybe even something
      far more bizarre and borderline heretical,<br />
      <br />
      <b>Tools of Judgement:</b> Two tools at the disposal of the SIlver Order stand out in their potency in combating
      the Daemon threat. The Silver Knights and the Biblos Anathema. As the Sworn Knights of the Order, the Silver
      Knights act as a virtually unmatched sword against the corruption. A small army created with the sole purpose of
      slaying Daemon with silver and flame. Where ever the Knights are to be found the Order is not far. While the
      Silver Knights provide the power needed to match the Dark God&apos;s chosen, it is not enough. The Biblos Anathema
      is the assembled knowledge of millennia of Exorcists, Warp-Researchers, Daemon Hunters, and the Emperor himself
      related to fighting Chaos. It contains myriad methods of identifying corruption, a trove of Daemonic True Names,
      and other lore. It is mankind&apos;s answer to the Aeldari Black Library, and its the ambition of Magnus Rubricar
      and Lord Paladin O&apos;Seimei for the Biblos Anathema to eventually surpass its Xeno equivalent. Aside from these
      major resources, the Order calls upon the resources of both the Adeptus Terran Mars. In the form of equipment,
      data, personal and experimental anti-Daemonic materials. The Silver Order has also been involved with the Imperial
      study of Blackstone, the eldritch warp-reactive substance coveted by many. <br />
      <br />
      <b>Recruitment: </b>Every member of the Silver Order traces their history back to a failure of the Imperium.
      Despite the great powers of the Legio Astartes, SIlver Order, and League of Black ships, the threat of Chaos still
      claims a grim toll. Many worlds burn under the wrath of the Dark Gods, leaving broken scraps of mankind in these
      tragedies&apos; wake. Most go mad, ending their lives or worse falling to Chaos. Some are made of sterner stuff
      and return the gaze of the abyss. Of these survivors, the greatest are brought to Titan. To be screened, trained,
      purified, exorcised, and readied for a life of service fighting the dark. Those that survive the training and
      possess the aptitude to be Agents face one final test. In the Anointing Chamber, a diluted cloned drop of the
      Emperor&apos;s own blood acts as the final judge. Its burns the skin and sears the Silver Order&apos;s mark into
      the initiates forehead. If any hint of corruption or weakness exists within the initiate, the cleansing fire of
      the Anathema will burn them to ash. Even after centuries of service, the anointed blood leaves a terrible trace. A
      safeguard against corruption. This doom hangs above all full Agents of the Silver Order, ready to strike them down
      at any moment of failing. Those that survive all these tests are apprenticed to a senior agent for a
      quarter-century of service, after which they are granted the Silver Seal of the order and set forth to hunt down
      the Lost, the Damned, and the Daemon. <br />
      <br />
      <b>White Magik: </b>The nature of the Silver Order&apos;s work requires heavy use of Warp Craft. With all the
      dangers involved with it. Additionally, the Order is also in steady contact with the powerful and unique style of
      Warp Craft utilized by the Master of Mankind and his closest servants. Naturally the SIlver Order has worked to
      study this method of Anathemic power. With limited success. While the exact method of how the Imperator and his
      sons dominate the Warp proves too much for most mortal souls. A discovery was made in studying the Lord Paladins.
      Agents of the Silver Order can use their connection to the Emperor via his blessed blood as a form of filter and
      limiter. Allowing the use of more precise and potent Warp Craft, or as some call it &quot;Magik.&quot; These
      discoveries have shown new potential methods of Warp Craft, especially when coupled with the Revelations pried
      from the Death World of Fenris. New arts to advance Mankinds&apos;s ascendency as a Psychic species while keeping
      back the fell power of Chaos.
