<br>
<br>
The lieutenant&#x2019;s quarters were easily the best maintained part of Outpost 501. That fact didn&#x2019;t surprise Ronnel in the least, despite the fact that before now he&#x2019;d never set foot here. <br>
<br>
Lieutenant Kisling was a small, tepid man with no chin and even less courage. The minor son of a bureaucrat, rumor around the outpost was that he has slunk through military academy and the only reason they didn&#x2019;t fail him was the instructors didn&#x2019;t want to risk the chance his father would be irate and schedule their next shipment of food to arrive 3 months late. <br>
<br>
Whatever the case was Kisling was living up to, or Ronnel thought that it might be better to say living down to his reputation. When the hulking figures of three Astartes (one being left behind to guard their precious cargo) barged through the doors to his quarters with Ronnel hot on Belath&#x2019;s heels, all the lieutenant could do was gawk at them and mouth words that couldn&#x2019;t quite make the journey out of his throat. The poor man wasn&#x2019;t even dressed, as he just lay there meekly in his cot wearing nothing but undergarments and a stupid, vacant expression on his face. <br>
<br>
&#x201C;Are you the commanding officer of this outpost?&#x201D; Dannos asked, brushing the dirt and debris off his armor that had collected there during the previous skirmish. <br>
<br>
&#x201C;I am Lieutenant Kisling and what in the Emperor&#x2019;s name are you doing in my outpost?&#x201D; the lieutenant asked, hurriedly trying to put on his trousers. &#x201C;I am the commanding officer here, and by the Emperor I will be forced to remove you from the premises if you don&#x2019;t submit to my autho-&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Quick as lightning, Belath had moved forward and put his hand around Kisling&#x2019;s throat, lifting him high into the air with effortless grace.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I would stop using His name if I were you.&#x201D; Belath growled. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t take kindly to such talk.&#x201D; <br>
<br>
&#x201C;This isn&#x2019;t the time nor the place, Belath.&#x201D; a third Astartes growled from behind. &#x201C;Put him down and let us talk.&#x201D; <br>
<br>
&#x201C;I concur.&#x201D; Dannos said, placing a hand on Belath&#x2019;s gigantic shoulder pauldron. &#x201C;It does nothing for us by killing the Lieutenant.&#x201D; <br>
<br>
With a huff, Belath opened his hand and Kisling dropped to all fours on the ground, gasping for air and rubbing the outside of his throat. Though still a pathetic creature, Ronnel thought he saw a hint of malice on the lieutenant&#x2019;s face. A look of loathing and bitter anger was there for a brief moment before it was gone and Kisling was trying to bring himself to his feat. <br>
&#x201C;Apologies for my brother, Lieutenant&#x2026;?&#x201D; Dannos continued. <br>
<br>
&#x201C;Kisling. Lieutenant Kisling.&#x201D; the lieutenant replied, still rubbing his throat. <br>
<br>
&#x201C;Ah, thank you Lieutenant Kisling.&#x201D; Dannos said with a nod. &#x201C;I am sure you have questions about what happened earlier this evening.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
A blank stare was all he got in return. <br>
<br>
&#x201C;The outpost came under attack recently, Lieutenant.&#x201D; Ronnel said apologetically, flinching unconsciously as his commanding officer&#x2019;s gaze bore into him. &#x201C;The Astartes&#x2019; shuttle crashed and we were attacked by a horde of crazed citizens. We were able to beat back the attack in the end however. Apologies to you, Ser Astartes. The Lieutenant would have been sleeping during the attack.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
It was a well known fact that Lieutenant Kisling was such a sound sleeper that people thought he could sleep through an Ork invasion happening right above his head. It wasn&#x2019;t too much of an exaggeration either. Sergeant Attacord had been the one to run things at Outpost 501, and now he was dead. Ronnel knew that Kisling would have to either step up himself or appoint someone to take Attacord&#x2019;s place. Without a doubt, Ronnel knew exactly which option he&#x2019;d be staking his entire life&#x2019;s savings on. <br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2026; I see.&#x201D; Dannos said before continuing. &#x201C;I would sit down, Lieutenant. This may take some time.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;A generation ago, your world was conquered by the Lunar Templars in the name of our Emperor. Your governor put up a defense, but it was easily crushed and blunted when appropriate. Within months, your barricades fell and your planet became a part of the Imperium. A truth, but not the whole truth.<br>
<br>
There is a legend on this planet. It is said a witch used to rule this place and did so for many years until she was overthrown by the people of this planet. Now her essence is in the planet itself and still watches over the people of Scylla to this day. <br>
<br>
There was no woman, and to call it a witch is a disservice. When we conquered your planet, the rulers of this place, including your leader, killed themselves rather than be taken alive. It was strange. There were no markings of a weapon, no poisons in their systems, not a single scratch on most of them. They had all been killed psychically, but by what?<br>
<br>
We have been searching on this planet for years, but several standard weeks ago, we finally found it. There is a statue, or more accurately a coffin, of whatever ruled the planet thousands of years ago. It is almost impossible to get a description, because whoever looks at this becomes horribly and irreversibly corrupted, but we believe it to depict some sort of xenos creature, and additional scans have shown us there is some sort of skeleton inside the stone. <br>
<br>
An agent of the Silver Order was dispatched, and five Astartes of the Silver Knights were to accompany him. We found&#x2026; disturbing results. If any person looks upon the statue, they immediately fall under the control of whatever is left of the creature inside. We don&#x2019;t know how they do it, Chaotic corruption is unconfirmed, but any person who looks upon it immediately finds it the most beautiful thing in the world and will do anything it can to preserve the statue and do its bidding. They call it the &#x2018;Queen&#x2019;, and behave however it wishes.Whispers enter into the minds of those who spend too long in its presence, and it can exert control over a person from well over a hundred kilometers away. We know this because that is how we landed in your outpost. <br>
<br>
Shortly after our confiscation of the statue, we were beset on all sides by those still under the Queen&#x2019;s control. Our best guess is that it had been biding its time, waiting centuries if it had to until we got complacent and it would retake control of this world. Its time was running out so it took a chance and sprung the trap early. We were able to call the Lunar Templars for assistance, but they won&#x2019;t get here until the morning. The planet is under siege. Cultists have been popping up left and right. The only reasons you didn&#x2019;t know I would expect is that they&#x2019;ve been blasting infected messages on the noosphere describing their Queen in detail. Corporal Fendt here says your techpriest ended their life with a plasma gun instead of succumbing. If only all communications officers had done that instead, we might not be in the middle of a war. <br>
<br>
We were flying on the last shuttle off Scylla before they overran the spaceport. But just as we were entering low orbit, a missile struck our shuttle and we plunged back down. Our Silver Order Agent was killed, as was our Cleanser. The rest of us only have passing knowledge on the Queen and we have been trying to do as best we can with limited information. Fortunately your outpost was nearby. We took your vehicles back here and just barely survived an encounter with the screaming cultists from the city. But there is still hope. We have a place to make a stand, the Lunar Templars know we haven&#x2019;t been taken yet, and here is where we shall wait until dawn for our rescue. Provided we can hold out the night, of course.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Kisling just stared at Dannos with a dumbfounded expression, that wasn&#x2019;t new for him. What was new was the look of anger on his face instead of confusion. Ronnel hadn&#x2019;t seen that from him before, and he wasn&#x2019;t sure if he liked it. <br>
<br>
&#x201C;You&#x2026; you... &#x201C; Kisling said, repeating himself over and over again in a fit of rage. &#x201C;You brought this to our outpost! How could you?! We aren&#x2019;t equipped to handle these sorts of things and you&#x2019;ve led them right to us!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You are called upon to do your duty to the Imperium.&#x201D; Belath growled, and Kisling shifted away from him ever so slightly. &#x201C;Ave Imperator, isn&#x2019;t that right? Lieutenant?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I mean, of course.&#x201D; Kisling said, clearly flustered and not eager to repeat his first encounter with the Emperor&#x2019;s champion. &#x201C;But this outpost isn&#x2019;t set up for such things. I can&#x2019;t be expected to survive a horde of rampaging maniacs without help!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
As if on cue, the power to Kisling&#x2019;s quarters went out. Ignoring Kisling&#x2019;s yelp of surprise, Ronnel poked his head out only to be greeted by pure blackness. The entire outposts seemed to have lost power. Ronnel was by no means a tactical genius, but he knew that this was a good sign that an attack was coming. <br>
<br>
&#x201C;It appears that your troops will be tested quite soon, Lieutenant.&#x201D; Dannos said with a soft chuckle. &#x201C;Come, we have some fighting to do.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well ah, Sergeant Attacord usually handled all of that.&#x201D; Kisling said apprehensively, trying to straighten his uniform in a vain attempt to appear more professional.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Did he now?&#x201D; Belath guffawed. &#x201C;Well me killing him probably makes that a little bit difficult. Tell you what I&#x2019;ll do for you instead.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Drawing his unignited power sword, he tapped it gently on each of Ronnel&#x2019;s shoulders. <br>
<br>
&#x201C;Congratulations on your promotion, Sergeant Fendt.&#x201D; Belath said with a huff. &#x201C;Now let&#x2019;s go save this place.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Ronnel knew that he should have said thank you. That he should have been overwhelmed by this promotion that was going to make his life so much easier from now on. But he didn&#x2019;t say a thing. He wanted to chalk it up to being awestruck by the Astartes, but that wasn&#x2019;t truly the reason. It wasn&#x2019;t even his glee at seeing Kisling dumbfounded with rage once again, although that was indeed enjoyable. No, the reason Ronnel just nodded and ran off towards the front of the outpost was because he was well and truly tired. Not just physically, but mentally too. He could feel it in his soul. This weariness that only a good night&#x2019;s rest would bring him seemed like it would be his constant companion for the time being. A good night&#x2019;s rest was about the least likely thing in his future at the moment. <br>
<br>
When they reached the front lines, it was black as pitch not twenty feet from the camp. The only source of illumination was the small, portable heat generators the soldiers used to make the chilly Scyllan nights more comfortable, but they gave precious little light and what light they did have was an eerie glow with an orange tint. Poor for morale, but even worse for seeing a target they needed to shoot. <br>
<br>
Not that they didn&#x2019;t have a general idea where the target was. No, that part was easily. The screaming and the hysterical laughter were right in front of them, but they couldn&#x2019;t quite see where it was coming from. Mercifully, the poorly trained soldiers knew enough not to fire. It would just be wasting ammunition. <br>
&#x201C;This is pointless.&#x201D; grumbled Belath, fumbling for something along his belt. &#x201C;Here, now you sorry lot can start shooting!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Ronnel could barely make out the outline of a gun that Belath raised into the air as he pulled the trigger. A flare rocketed out of the barrel and exploded a hundred feet up in the air, casting a harsh light over the surrounding countryside and clearly exposing the crazed cultists rushing towards them. <br>
<br>
&#x201C;You have about five minutes.&#x201D; the Astartes growled as he and his companions readied their weapons. <br>
<br>
&#x201C;You heard the Astartes!&#x201D; Ronnel shouted, waving his own lasrifle around in an effort to rally the men. &#x201C;Open fire, before we lose the light!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
It was a glorious sight. A sight played out on countless words over the past two centuries, but a glorious sight nonetheless. Hellguns, Flamers, the occasional Plasma, as well as Krak and Frag grenades in support, unleashed death upon their enemies. If there was one thing that Imperial Auxilia forces were good for, it was bringing overwhelming firepower to bear upon their foes. <br>
<br>
Scores of crazed humans dropped dead, their bodies torn to shreds as bolts, lasers, and shrapnel cut through them. They were mowed down like a late summer&#x2019;s harvest, but even that still failed to make a manageable dent in their numbers. The horde seemed endless, and it was getting closer. <br>
<br>
Five minutes later, with most of the ammunition spent, the flare slowly flicked and died high up in the Scyllian sky. They were without a light source, low on ammunition, and their chances of victory seemed slim. <br>
<br>
&#x201C;Prepare for melee!&#x201D; Ronnel screamed, drawing his standard-issue combat knife from his holster as he saw his men do the same. Belath ignited his powersword with a chuckle and he saw the other three Astartes prepare their own melee weapons as well. &#x201C;Here they come!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Then the horde was upon them. It was all a blur to Ronnel. People were screaming and throwing themselves at him, but they were barely even managing to grab his uniform. It was clear that whatever was inside that statue was sacrificing dexterity and simple motor function for overwhelming numbers. It wasn&#x2019;t a bad strategy, but Ronnel was starting to see the weak point in it. There might have been a thousand of them for every soldier, but every soldier was worth at least a thousand crazed horde members. <br>
<br>
Miraculously, the horde was dying down. Ronnel had even begun to notice that he needed to be careful where he was swinging his knife. Before he could attack with abandon and he would be sure to hit some part of an enslaved human. Now, their numbers were thinning down enough that his blade bounced off Belath&#x2019;s armor on a particularly wild and errant swing. He hoped the giant had been too busy to notice. <br>
<br>
As soon as it began, it seemed to stop with equal suddenness. One moment Ronnel was jamming his knife into the throat of a screaming human, and the next he was simply surrounded by dead bodies. <br>
<br>
It was over. They had won. <br>
<br>
A ragged and hoarse cheer went up from the men. They were relieved to have lived through that. People he had never even met before were coming up to him and thanking him for saving their lives and giving them leadership. It was a weird feeling, and one that Ronnel wasn&#x2019;t too sure he was comfortable with. He was used to working without praise and it felt weird to receive it now. <br>
<br>
Not everyone had lived to see this victory though. Hundreds of his comrades lay dead or dying, and there were two Astartes among the dead, the two that Ronnel had not yet interacted with. Belath knelt by the bodies, performing what the new sergeant could only guess were the last rites of that enigmatic branch of warriors. <br>
<br>
&#x201C;You did well, lad.&#x201D; Dannos said, appearing beside him and placing a gargantuan, armored hand on his shoulder, slapping it affectionately. <br>
<br>
&#x201C;Indeed,&#x201D; came Lieutenant Kislings voice, stepping out of the shadows in order to be seen congratulating the hero of the hour. Conspicuously, his uniform didn&#x2019;t have a drop of blood on it. <br>
<br>
&#x201C;Well done, Fendt. It seems your promotion to Sergeant was well earned. I shall make sure to include your name in my report to headquarters.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You can&#x2019;t do that now, I&#x2019;m afraid.&#x201D; Dannos said. &#x201C;Your communications are shot, remember? We are on our own out here, cut off from the rest of the world, practically speaking.&#x201D; <br>
<br>
&#x201C;Then, are we to die anyway?!&#x201D; Kisling sputtered. &#x201C;Even after we so gloriously defended your cargo?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The good news is it looks like we took care of the enemy sent to get us.&#x201D; Dannos replied. &#x201C;Our allies might not know where we are, but neither does the enemy. It is a temporary advantage though. Our foes will find us much sooner than our friends if we let them.&#x201D; <br>
<br>
&#x201C;Then let us remove that chance.&#x201D; Belath stated, rising up from beside his fallen battle brothers and walking over towards the group. &#x201C;I can go and try to get help, see if I cannot find another camp and see if their communications are working, perhaps even find loyal allies. I can let them know exactly where we are. I&#x2019;m the best fighter here, and I&#x2019;ll be faster if I&#x2019;m alone.&#x201D; <br>
<br>
Kisling looked as though he had just tasted something extremely bitter when he looked at the massive warrior. Ronnel could even make out the faintest hint of a bruise on the lieutenant&#x2019;s throat from where Belath had tried to strangle him earlier. <br>
<br>
&#x201C;Very well.&#x201D; the lieutenant finally said. &#x201C;I give you leave to go and search for help.&#x201D; <br>
<br>
&#x201C;Wasn&#x2019;t asking for your permission.&#x201D; Belath chuckled as he sheathed his blade and rummaged for a map of the area to get his bearings. &#x201C;Thank you for the consent anyways. Perhaps I&#x2019;ll even mention you in my own report.&#x201D; <br>
<br>
With that, he was gone, off and over the hills surrounding Outpost 501. Though he was one man, it seemed much emptier without him. The soldiers could sense something amiss as well. Though they still went about clearing the area of corpses, it was clear they were much more distracted now. <br>
<br>
&#x201C;I must attend to my own dead brothers.&#x201D; Dannos said, nodding at Ronnel. &#x201C;I would ask more of your time when you have it, Sergeant Fendt.&#x201D; <br>
<br>
&#x201C;I believe I am free, sir.&#x201D; Ronnel replied before Kisling cleared his throat and jerked his head to indicate a need to talk. Dannos was already gone, not even having heard Ronnel&#x2019;s reply, so the sergeant didn&#x2019;t see the harm in humoring his lieutenant before being on his way. <br>
<br>
&#x201C;Good work out there, Fendt.&#x201D; Kisling said. Giving Ronnel an approving pat on the back as he came closer. Ronnel had to stifle a chuckle. Two weeks ago, Kisling had mistakenly called him &#x2018;Bent&#x2019; while in line for food and when Ronnel had corrected him, the lieutenant pretended not to hear him and be preoccupied with something only he could see. What a difference two weeks had made. <br>
<br>
&#x201C;Good work, very good work indeed.&#x201D; Kisling mused, not even really seeing Ronnel as he stood there. &#x201C;This could work out in our favor Fendt, but only if we play this wisely. Do you have any experience with Imperial politics?&#x201D; <br>
<br>
&#x201C;No, sir.&#x201D; Ronnel sighed. How in the world was he supposed to have experience with politics?<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Ah, I had thought as much.&#x201D; the lieutenant continued. &#x201C;This whole thing will be good for us Fendt, very good indeed. There will be promotions in this for sure. Not only for our valor, but also because I&#x2019;m sure a lot of high ranking people just died above us in the hierarchy, Emperor give them peace.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Ronnel just stared at the lieutenant dumbfounded. They had only just beaten back an attack that had almost cost them all their lives, and here was Kisling trying to politically maneuver his way into a better position. His tenacity was almost admirable. <br>
<br>
&#x201C;I see a reward in your future, but you might lose it because of your inexperience for how this game is played.&#x201D; Kisling said. &#x201C;You&#x2019;ll need an ally, a friend to help you navigate all of this. I could do that for you. Don&#x2019;t you think we&#x2019;re friends, Fendt? Comrades in arms, forged in the fires of combat?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Sure. I guess.&#x201D; Ronnel replied, highly uncomfortable with how friendly Kisling was being at the moment. <br>
<br>
&#x201C;Excellent&#x2026; excellent. This shall work out nicely for the both of us.&#x201D; Kisling said. &#x201C;You leave all the details to me. I&#x2019;ll save you the trouble of drafting a speech for the fallen. In fact I could give it myself if need be. In fact, why don&#x2019;t I just write up the whole report and give the summary to high command? It doesn&#x2019;t seem fair to ask you to do all of that I what I really want for you coming out of this is for you to get a greater sense for how-&#x201D; <br>
<br>
Kisling stopped mid-sentence, whirling behind him as if something was buzzing at his ear. <br>
<br>
&#x201C;Did you hear that? Sounded like someone spoke right behind me.&#x201D; <br>
<br>
Ronnel was extremely confused now, and his discomfort was only rising. <br>
<br>
&#x201C;Sir, I didn&#x2019;t see anything. But I see what you&#x2019;re saying and I agree with all that you said before. Can I leave now?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Hmm? Oh yes, you can go Bent.&#x201D; Kisling said, looking back and forth looking for the source of the noise only he had heard. &#x201C;We&#x2019;ll talk later I suppose.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Ronnel couldn&#x2019;t get out of there fast enough, and made his way quickly over to the structure where Dannos and the two dead Astartes lay. Dannos was inside, sitting by the two dead soldiers and performing his own last rites over the body. <br>
<br>
&#x201C;Good of you to come, Fendt.&#x201D; Dannos said warmly, motioning for Ronnel to take a seat beside him. &#x201C;I was their Shield, you know. The one charged with protecting them in the heat of combat. This failure will sting hard, and I shall have to do some serious introspection before all of this is over. Thank you for being here, to hear my confession and to help witness my failings.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Ronnel wasn&#x2019;t sure what he was supposed to say to that, so he just simply sat in silence, waiting for the man to continue talking. <br>
<br>
&#x201C;You don&#x2019;t speak just to fill the void with sound.&#x201D; Dannos chuckled. &#x201C;That is a good quality to have. You will do well in life if you can master that talent. But come, I am sure there are more questions you have to ask. While I extract their Ghost Hearts, I would hear them if you wish.&#x201D; <br>
<br>
Ronnel had to bite his tongue when he thought to ask what a Ghost Heart was. He figured that it wouldn&#x2019;t matter, and definitely wasn&#x2019;t that important to him. There were bigger questions that needed answering than that. <br>
<br>
&#x201C;What is happening? Really?&#x201D; Ronnel asked. &#x201C;And you know what I mean. This is bigger than just Scylla, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201D;<br>
<br>
He thought he&#x2019;d get another small chuckle out of the Astartes, perhaps another pat on the back and some sort of cryptic half-truth. Instead the soldier just sighed and continued his work. Plunging deep into the chest of one of the fallen. <br>
<br>
He extracted a heart, or at least a crystal with some sort of heart-looking muscle over the top of it and showed it to Ronnel. <br>
<br>
&#x201C;This is what is happening.&#x201D; Dannos said cryptically. &#x201C;There is a war going on, Ronnel Fendt. It has been happening for millions of years, and this is but the latest chapter in a very, very long war. We all have souls, you see. We have a spark of life, something that cannot be truly replicated, no matter how hard a person might try. And there are&#x2026; things out there. Things of which i will not name here. Great and terrible things full of mighty power. They seek souls like the one encased in crystal here. Encased in crystal so it will not fall victim to these forces. They are humanity&#x2019;s true enemy, and they hunger ever so greatly, either for our service or our souls. I am but a soldier in this war, seeking to protect humanity from those who would devour us in ways far crueler than just consuming us physically. And after tonight, you are a soldier too.&#x201D; <br>
<br>
It struck a chord with Ronnel. Things were starting to make sense, albeit barely. Strangely enough, he felt a strange sense of peace when Dannos started talking. As if this was somehow related to a purpose that had been put in place for Ronnel. His whole life he had felt this angst and frustration over feeling bored and underutilized. For the first time in his life, he felt as if there was something greater than himself out there. Something that he desperately wanted to be a part of. <br>
<br>
&#x201C;Is it possible to join this war? Fully, I mean.&#x201D; Ronnel asked. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry, I just felt like I had to ask.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Dannos put up a hand to stop more of the apology that was forthcoming. <br>
<br>
&#x201C;No need to apologize.&#x201D; he assured the young sergeant. &#x201C;You have done well tonight, better than anyone could have expected. Let us survive the night, and then we shall see what tomorrow brings for the both of us.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The door to the structure opened and a soldier came in, walking straight towards them once he spotted the two of them huddled over the corpses. <br>
<br>
&#x201C;What news?&#x201D; Dannos asked, not even looking up from his work as huddled over his head comrades. &#x201C;Tell Kisling that unless there is an attack I shall be done here shortly. Take Fendt with you if it is urgent.&#x201D; <br>
<br>
The soldier didn&#x2019;t respond, didn&#x2019;t even alter their expression. The man simply raised his pistol to Dannos&#x2019; head and pulled the trigger. <br>
<br>
**Kraaak**<br>
<br>
**Kraaak**<br>
<br>
**Kraaak**<br>
<br>
Ronnel was lucky. The man was so focused on emptying his clip into what was left of Dannos&#x2019; head that it gave the sergeant time to draw his own pistol and start firing. Even luckier, there were only two shots left in Ronnel&#x2019;s pistol and because he was able to shoot a man not even looking at him, he was able to make the shots count. <br>
<br>
Dannos slumped over, everything above his shoulders was a smoking wreck. He was dead, not even an Astartes could come back from that. Their assassin was luckier. Stress, surprise, and fatigue had made Ronnel miss his mark and he tried to sit upright, chuckling weakly as he did so. <br>
<br>
&#x201C;Why did you shoot that Astartes?!&#x201D; Ronnel yelled, drawing his knife out and holding it to the man&#x2019;s throat. &#x201C;Answer me!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;She&#x2019;s so beautiful.&#x201D; the man wheezed, coughing up blood as he did so. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t even know why I was fighting before. All you have to do is see her too. Then she&#x2019;ll take the pain away. It&#x2019;s funny, this doesn&#x2019;t even hurt.&#x201D; <br>
<br>
With one final wheeze, he slumped over dead. A smile still etched across his face. <br>
<br>
It was like time had come to a halt. Ronnel&#x2019;s brain was moving so fast it made him dizzy. This man had seen the statue. But how? Why? Who else had been compromised? <br>
<br>
Ronnel couldn&#x2019;t answer any of those questions now, but there was one thing he knew for sure: he needed a new weapon. <br>
<br>
Where to get one? The armory had been emptied in preparation for the attack, and he wasn&#x2019;t about to risk going out in public to find one. He needed something that people had overlooked. It hit him like a bolt of lightning. Kisling&#x2019;s quarters! There was bound to be a weapon there, and no way that fool had brought it with him to the front lines. <br>
<br>
The pathway to the lieutenant&#x2019;s habitat was completely deserted, and it unnerved Ronnel to hear how quiet it was. Something was definitely wrong here. Very, very wrong. <br>
<br>
Mercifully, Kisling&#x2019;s room was unlocked, as was his personal locker. Ronnel started to prematurely congratulate himself on a solution to his problems. Clearly fate was with him. <br>
<br>
He should have known better. This was Scylla, after all. The lieutenant had a common laspistol alright, but it was completely dead, lacking a charge of any kind. And to top it all off, the blithering idiot hadn&#x2019;t stored any spare charge packs. It was completely useless, expect maybe as a weapon to bluff his opponents. Make them think it was charged when it really wasn&#x2019;t and use the implied threat as a way to escape. But even that had risks. Suppose that Kisling was among the people who had been turned and he still had enough wits about him to remember the pistol had no charge? It would be a disaster waiting to happen. It would be even worse than no weapon at all! This was horrible, and it was about to get even worse. <br>
<br>
The intercom system sounded to life, and Ronnel looked at the speaker in Kisling&#x2019;s room with a sense of rising dread. <br>
<br>
&#x201C;Paging Corporal- I mean Sergeant Fendt. *heh-heh*.&#x201D; came the voice from the intercom. Ronnel could recognize Kisling&#x2019;s voice anywhere, but something was terribly wrong here.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I looked, Fendt. The voices told me it was alright *huh-huh-huh*. She&#x2019;s beautiful, so beautiful. The rest of the people agree with me. They all saw her. I&#x2019;m guessing you haven&#x2019;t because you killed the one I sent to kill you *ha ha*. Tell you what Fendt, why don&#x2019;t you just look at her and we&#x2019;ll call it even? You&#x2019;ll forget why you&#x2019;re mad in the first place *hahahahaha*. <br>
<br>
I&#x2019;m sorry, it&#x2019;s just funny. I don&#x2019;t feel it anymore. Any of it. No more pain, no more fear, no more weakness. I was so weak before. Have you ever felt weak, Fendt? I know you have. We all do. She takes that away from us. Now I have **purpose**. I have direction. You should let her take it all away. Just do what she says. It feels so right when you do.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
A cold pit started to form in Ronnel&#x2019;s stomach. Everyone but him had been turned. They would either kill him or make him one of them.<br>
<br>
What could he do? Could he just wait somewhere safe until Belath returned? No, that wasn&#x2019;t an option. What if Belath had gotten lost? Captured? What if he led them back here but the statue corrupted them? What if Kisling ambushed them like he&#x2019;d surprised Dannos? Besides, there was no guarantee he&#x2019;d be safe anywhere. They still had hours to look for him until the earliest possibility of help arrived. <br>
<br>
He would have to stop them somehow. But he was alone. Wanting to stop them was one thing, being able to do it was something else entirely. He had no weapon, no plan, and no allies. Not exactly the most ideal situation. <br>
<br>
For the first time in years, Ronnel Fendt started to cry. It was just so unfair. None of this was right, none of it! A dark thought entered into his mind that maybe if he wasn&#x2019;t such a coward he could stick a piece of metal into the charging socket and kill himself. It would be a nasty way to go, but it would be better than what his former comrades had in mind for him. <br>
<br>
That nasty thought was immediately replaced by a much better one. He sat upright with a wide grin on his face. He had a plan. It was a risky one, maybe even downright stupid, but it was better than nothing. Even better, he was sure it was going to take Kisling by surprise, even if he was guided by some sort of foul, alien intelligence. <br>
<br>
Opening the doors of Kisling&#x2019;s quarters as quietly as he could, Ronnel Fendt slunk off into the night. Not to flee, but to prepare. If he was going to have a shot at this, he needed to make sure everything was in place. <br>
<br>
He knew what he had to do, now it was up to fate to see if he could pull it off.<div class="sidenav-right"><a type="button" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="1513216296000--Threadmarks_Chapter One.html"></a></div></div></body></html>
