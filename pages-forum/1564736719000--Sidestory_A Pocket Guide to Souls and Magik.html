A Pocket Guide to the Warp, Magik, Souls and more.<br>
<br>
The Warp is the dimension of possibility and uncertain reality that underlies the material universe. It is a place of infinite matter, energy, time, space, and existence. Where everything and anything that can and cannot exist does. Sentient beings in the Materium constantly generate new possibilities and impossibilities via our thoughts and actions. As such, most all sentient beings possess a connection to the warp based on our ability to affect it. This is a Soul, a bridge between material and immaterial born of life. Warp-Stuff is the raw components of existence. It is to matter/energy/space/time/etc what stem cells are to organic tissue. This is molded into its various forms by the Material universe effecting the Warp through.<br>
<br>
With most beings, the Warps energy flows through the conduit into the Material. Some have larger and/or more stable warp-conduits. Allowing them to draw the matter/energy (warp stuff) of the Warp into the materium and manipulate it. These are psykers.<br>
<br>
Other anomalous beings have a neutral connection. Their soul does not transfer the immaterial into the material or reverse. Making them seem like soulless, while making it so their presence dampens warp phenomena encroaching on the material. Much like a chemically inert substance hinders a reaction. Sufficient transfer of energy either way can make these beings Souled beings or Anti-souls. These are Blanks.<br>
<br>
Rarest of all are the Anti-Souls, beings Conduits where the Material flows into the Immaterial. This is extremely damaging to the Warp. Since the dread certainty of the material universe causes the Warps infinite possibilities to collapse. Anti-Souls very existence causes destress and damage to Warp Beings and Warp Conduits (souls.) Powerful and well trained Anti-Souls can harness this power much like a Psyker can their connection. These are Pariahs.<br>
<br>
That&apos;s the basics of the Souls. Now what gets interesting is how a Powerful soul interacts with the Warp. By siphoning power from the Warp they attract the attention of Warp Predators. Who can sometimes overpower the Psyker and travel along their conduit to possess their body and in extreme cases rip open the conduit causing a Warp-Gate. Which requires a steady stream of power from both Material and Warp ends of the connection to stay open. Exception exist like the Eye of Terror and other similar permanent rips.<br>
Because of this danger, Psykers have to be very careful, only pulling the minimum amount of power through their souls. While holding back the Warps dangers. Different grades of Psykers can use different amounts of warp-stuff. With some barely able to alter probability, and others nuking planets with a thought. Think of it like a powerline and a Psyker is a transformer. The better the transformer the more power it can draw, but if it draws too much.... Kaboom!<br>
Certain beings with unique souls can control exactly how much and how the channeled Warp Power is used. These beings require an extremely powerful soul, divine willpower and an Anathemetic Spark. The Primarchs, the Eldar Gods and a few other beings fall into this category. The Emperor and fellow Anathemas are something beyond even this.<br>
<br>
Warp-Stuff is the raw substance of the Warp and Psykers can channel it. They use it to power psychic abilities. The different Psychic disciplines are just ways of using Warp-Stuff. Biomancy is using it to control organic tissue. Pyromancy is using it to fuel chemical reactions or energy discharges. So on and so forth. The problem with this style of Psychic Power is it relies on Warp-Stuff that is unspecialized and brutish. The warp equivalent of using Direct Current. Requires a lot more power and with lesser results. In ancient times when the Warp was calmer the Old Ones could take Warp-Stuff and basically refine it into different flavors, or &quot;winds&quot; of Warp-Stuff. Like creating matter or energy from nothing, effecting space/time or spontaneously generating life. The art of doing this is Magik. It&apos;s far more powerful, easily specialized and can more permanently affect the Material. Problem is the process of refining Warp-Stuff requires channeling huge amounts of stuff through large stable warp-rifts. While exposing a being&apos;s body and mind to it. Creating a perfect opportunity for Warp Predators. Which are virtually infinite post-War in Heaven. In places where they are less common or by using a foci of some kind these ancient arts might be restored.<br>
<br>
The various Winds recorded in WHFB are the tip of the iceberg. Warp-Stuff can be transformed into virtually anything the material universe can imagine. The threat of Daemons and the Psykers own potential are the only real limits. Even in 40k some scraps of these powers still exist. The Craftworlders literally sing Wraithbone into existence out of Warp-Stuff. The Orks have inbuilt macro-probability modification powers. The Webway Soul Engines can create and manipulate space/time. Sorcery can do some ultra sketchy versions of it, that basically require placating the Daemons that would usually use the opportunity to possess the Psyker. Beings that are sort of immune to Chaos can bypass a lot of the dangers with Magik. Which raises some interesting thoughts considering the Emperor&apos;s grand plans involving daemon-proofing Mankind<br>
