<b>Xeno Amblicalius:</b> Trileen (Rerum Trilobito Sapian)<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Threat Level</b>: <u>Salutari-6</u>. Limited to one planet, with intense biological requirements making expansion into Imperial space unlikely and impractical<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Description:</b> The Trileen are a species of sapient filter-feeding anthropods who evolved naturally on the world Imperial stellartograpahers refer to as Tragedy. Ranging usually 3-4 meters in length and 2 meters tall. With a squat elongated frame, carried by eight anthropoidal limbs, and four more delicate manipulator limbs near the creatures head and sensory organs. The bulbous head of the Trileen holds a cavernous mouth filled with baffles of baleen-equivalent. This combined with the unique dual breathing system of the Xeno, possessing both Book and Lobe lung systems, allows them to constantly circulate a large quantity of atmosphere through their baleen to feed and breath. The head also holds compound eyes, feelers that respond to chemical and tactile signals, and a powerful auditory system. Overall, the Trileen display convergent evolution similar to ancient Terran aquatic anthropods. Acting as social filter feeders in the early days of civilization. Additionally, the Trileen display very high levels of phenotypical difference between tribal groupings. With vibrant colors, differently shaped shells, and spines marking out different ethnic groups. This is believed to be a curious evolutionary side effect of the abundant and often chemically rich atmosphere plankton the Trileen feed off. With different regional diets resulting in different concentrations of biological markers and dyes. Leading to drastically different phenotypes further enforced by artificial selection. However richer pigments and more elaborate shells seem to be a fairly standard mark of social hierarchy. Since they are marks of a rich and diverse diet. Psychologically the Trileen are on average fairly simple beings, not unintelligent but remarkably passive and calm. Patience, forethought and a lack of the emotion humans call boredom appear to be side effects of evolving from filter-feeding grazer beasts, instead of competitive tree-dwelling primates. Making these fairly long-lived (250-500 SOLY) beings placid and not particularly rushed to make decisions or experiment with new possibilities.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>History and Culture</b>- Archeological records indicate the Trileen is a &quot;natural&quot; species, showing no detectable signs of Xeno (or human) influence on their evolutionary development. Instead evolving from a line of larger grazer beasts who worked together to find the best quality air plankton, and eventually cultivate this highly nutritious substance. Demonstrating a markedly slower path of evolution and cultural development the Trileen are 2-3 million years older than mankind and were first discovering wide-scale agriculture when humanity first started walking upright. Eventually developing into a culture of sedentary Clans, each ruling a fief selected for its Plankton crop or other resources. These Clans join together in large nations for trade and mutual defense. Against rival clans coveting prize plankton fields or dangerous wild beasts. By the time of Imperial arrival, the most advanced cultures of the Trileen had started to develop a printed language, translating the old tactile words into a print that could be distributed. Starting the beginnings of a renaissance of ideas and culture. Leading to some social upheaval and questioning of the old Ancestor Cults. The only form of Religion found among the Trileen, who use the shells of the deceased in grim art and craft as memorials. With Shellmounte Nonus worshipped as a kind of &quot;ancestor of ancestors&quot; and ultimate protector spirit. Feudal wars over resources and territory are not common but not unheard of on Tragedy, with the Trileen only moving to such an action when all other possibilities have been exhausted. However, when roused to war the Trileen are notable resilient and stubborn. War being a grinding thing of attrition and cost calculation. The invention of primitive pressure guns has not changed this much, with only the largest caliber weapons capable of piercing a full-grown Trileen&apos;s shell.<br>

<b>Homeworld:</b> Tragedy is smaller than Terra, with 0.74 Gravity and an atmosphere many times denser than the Old Earths. Particularly its oxygen concentration is much higher than what humans find comfortable, and its humidity outclasses most Jungle Worlds. Resulting in a thick and wet atmosphere teeming with lifeforms whose analog on other planets dwell in the oceans. Including shoals of buoyant plankton, gelatinous gas-bags the size of clouds and meter long flat worm-equivalents who can glide on turbulent winds. The surface of the planet and its true Oceans are also home to large varieties of Anthropods, Mammalian and reptilian life not present on the planet. Including a few truly monumental organisims like what Imperial Scouts call &quot;Rockslide Crabs.&quot; Boulder-sized crustaceans that travel in large herds across both dry land and the Ocean floor. Spore, polyps, and other microorganisms fill the skies of Tragedy, making it appear a constant heavy haze falls across the planet. Much of them orginating in the main form of foliage on Tragedy. Dry-Coral, a family of organisms that produce titanic reef ecosystems that stretch across parts of Tragedy. Creating entire mountains of life that poke into the planet&apos;s Upper atmosphere and support huge quantities of life. Large Predators, particularly in the form of cephalopod-equivalents stalk these Dry-Reefs and surrounding lands. Combining incredible strength and venomous barbs to hunt the armored anthropods of Tragedy, including the Trileen. Who fear one of these tentacled predator species in particular. Known to them as the Crawling-Shadow, it is a multi-ton, dozens of meters long mass of tentacles that slide along the ground at incredible speed. Its dark coloration and boneless nature let it slip between shadows with surprising stealth and mobility.<br>

<b>Relevant Technology: </b>Of all the resources and technology available to the Trileen, one thing, in particular, shows potential value to mankind. Their agriculture is semi-unique, with some interesting off-world possibilities. Especially the domestication of Dry-Coral as a self-repairing building material. It acts as a powerful atmospheric filter and replenishing building material. With some modification and genetic splicing, it might have use on Hive Worlds with dense atmospheres. If tweaked to be hardier and more resistant to pollutants it might act as a form of Atmosphere scrubber that builds with what it takes out of smog-choked skies of a Hive. In addition, the cultivation and husbandry of Atmospheric Plankton might be further developed. A noted pre-Old Night research project in the Jovian Moons worked to develop ways to farm inside the atmosphere of Gas Giants. The genetics of this Plankton and the techniques used to farm them might contribute to a resurrection of such a project without the aid of Abominable Intelligence. If compliance fails the Trileen&apos;s status as Egg layers with strong exoskeletons would make them excellent menial laborers during slow xenocide by forced sterilization if needed. If they prove compliant their expertise in these forms of agriculture might prove valuable.<div class="sidenav-right"><a type="button" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="1513216296000--Threadmarks_Chapter One.html"></a></div><div class="sidenav-right"><a type="button" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="1513216296000--Threadmarks_Chapter One.html"></a></div><div class="sidenav-right"><a type="button" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="1513216296000--Threadmarks_Chapter One.html"></a></div><div class="sidenav-right"><a type="button" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="1611683936000--Threadmarks_Chapter Twenty-Six (Part III).html"></a></div></div><div class="sidenav-right"><a type="button" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="1513216296000--Threadmarks_Chapter One.html"></a></div><div class="sidenav-right"><a type="button" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="1513216296000--Threadmarks_Chapter One.html"></a></div><div class="sidenav-right"><a type="button" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="1611683936000--Threadmarks_Chapter Twenty-Six (Part III).html"></a></div></div><div class="sidenav-right"><a type="button" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="1513216296000--Threadmarks_Chapter One.html"></a></div><div class="sidenav-right"><a type="button" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="1611683936000--Threadmarks_Chapter Twenty-Six (Part III).html"></a></div></div><div class="sidenav-right"><a type="button" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="1611683936000--Threadmarks_Chapter Twenty-Six (Part III).html"></a></div></div></body></html>
