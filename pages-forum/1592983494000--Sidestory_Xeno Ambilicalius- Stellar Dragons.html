<br>
<b>Description:</b> Ancient and incredibly powerful. The Stellar Dragons are an ancient race of guardians. Created by the Old Ones to be the perfect wardens and stewards. Hundreds of feet in length at the smallest. To kilometers long in the most ancient and powerful. Capable of adapting to practically any environment the Stellar Dragons take many forms. Sharing a few abilities and features across the species. Every Dragon is reptilian in appearance. From serpent-like scaled bodies. Or squat armored sauropods, to feathered avian forms. Possessing at least one set of limbs, and often far more. One or more of these sets of limbs are always wings. Which have organic chemical thrusters built into them. Allowing Dragons to navigate in Zero-G, and with sufficient energy, escape most gravity wells. The biology of these beasts is extremely efficient and relies on a psychic element. Producing energy in quantities similar to a nuclear reactor. This energy can be utilized for more than biological functions. Powering flight and letting the Stellar Dragons unleash gouts of plasma as a weapon. Additionally, upon reaching maturity every Stellar Dragon is a powerful psyker. With reserves of psychic potential equivalent to Alpha class humans. However, the design of the Old Ones limits the Stellar Dragon&#x2019;s use of this power. Capable of directing their psychic energy to only a few primitive arts. Such as basic telepathy, emotion projection, pyrokinesis, and telekinesis. The singular unique ability of the Stellar Dragons is the capability of diving into the Warp. This process is known as Doom-Diving. With Stellar Dragons ripping open a warp rift with a mighty roar. Then coating themselves in a layer of plasma and ignited warp-stuff. Finally diving into the Warp itself like a living starship. Protected by flames both physical and spiritual. Breaching from the Warp at the desired location in a corona of fire. The Stellar Dragons are a species of incredible power. Almost rendered extinct by the death of there creators and the galaxies cruelty. Now reborn in the service of mankind. <br>
<br>
<br>
<b>History</b>- At the height of the Empire of the Slaani, or Old Ones as they came to be known. Powerful relics, tools, and locations of the Old Ones required guardians. Powerful yet loyal beings that could defend these treasures. The Stellar Dragons were created for this purpose. They were designed to be powerful stewards who would instinctively collect and protect things of value, only relinquishing these treasures at the command of a sufficiently powerful psyker or God-called entity. Raised from ancient lizard stock and imbued with divine essence. For millions of years, the Stellar Dragons served as the guardians of the Old One&#x2019;s treasures before ultimately facing the nightmarish threats of the War in Heaven along with the rest of the Old Ones&#x2019; vassal species. Many of the most dangerous items the Stellar Dragons guarded were used to battle the Necrons and C&#x2019;tan, freeing up the dragons to fight alongside the Aeldari, Krork, K&#x2019;nib, Slaanspawn, and other children of the ancients. Millions of dragons and their lesser kin, the drakes, died fighting the Star Gods. Who hungered for the Dragons souls nearly as much as they did the Old Ones. When the War in Heaven reached its dreadful climax where gods of the material were shattered and mad gods of the immaterial were erased. A handful of the Stellar Drakes survived and returned to their duties of guarding the surviving treasures of the Old Ones. Coming into conflict with unworthy heirs to a godlike legacy. Eventually being whittled down to near extinction by the ages and unable to reproduce properly without the Old Ones. Leaving only a few descendent species and maddened survivors behind. Until the fall of Nocturne, were numerous powers converged to rebirth the Stellar Dragons. The Ayidakin Dragons of the Imperium, striving to recapture the ancient glory of there ancestors. <br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Habitable Zones and Behavior:</b> The Stellar Drakes are an extremely adaptive and hardy species. Capable of surviving nearly anywhere. Adapting to environmental challenges through psychically enhanced genetics. Allowing evolutionary change within a living organism. Resulting in highly varied appearance and attributes. With each fully grown Stellar Dragon being a unique organism. Sharing only a few basic features, oftentimes with divergent purpose. One Dragon&#x2019;s wings might be great sails of skin to soar across a gas giant. Another might use its armored wing-limbs to help steer itself between lava flows. Two things are universal among Stellar Drakes in choice of territory. The species will settle on worlds rich in either rare minerals and substances. Or worlds hosting ancient ruins and relics of the Old Ones and other psyker species. Preferring planets with both if possible. Once settled on these planets the Stellar Dragons will guard the planet zealously. Only sharing the planet and often the entire star system with mates or kin. With the Dragons nesting near places of psychic power, instinctually guarding treasures from all but the mightiest foe. <br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Reproduction and Lifecycle: </b>Stellar Dragons are beings steeped in both the warp and material. Requiring far less sustenance than their massive bulk would suggest. Capable of using prodigious psychic energy to maintain themselves. However, they still feed on the bounty of their territory. Be it flesh, or plant life. Additionally, Stellar Dragons devour small quantities of rare minerals and other inorganic substances. The volcanic digestive system of the beast processing the materials for use in scales, bones, or rarely eggs. When a female Dragon is well-fed for a significant period of time. She will start to lay eggs and call into the warp. Summoning possible mates. Who will then battle for the right to mate. The victor and the egglaying dragon will mate and produce a clutch equal of varying sizes. Alien genetic and psychic powers will ensure the eggs hatch into Drakes perfectly adapted to the world they were incubated upon. After a few decades, the Drakes will reach full maturity. Existing as unique lifeforms. At this point, the male dragon will depart and the Drakes will leave the mother&#x2019;s nest. Where they can develop into an entirely new species to populate and defend the planet. Drakes only become full-grown Stellar Dragons when exposed to sufficient amounts of psychic power. Experiencing a period where they will gorge themselves and metamorphize into a new Stellar Drake. Departing the world of their birth and seeking territory of its own. <br>

<b>Known Subspecies or Descendants-</b><br>
<br>
Nocturne Fire Drakes- SSI-5. Giant reptilian beasts from the now destroyed death world of Nocturne. Capable of perpetual growth until they reach unsustainable size. Extremely strong, durable, and capable of storing and utilizing heat. The descendant of Stellar Dragons living on Nocturne a few millions of years ago. <br>
<br>
Croatalid- SSI-3. Partially aquatic reptilian ambush predators. Large numbers are capable of producing psychic phenomena in the form of producing unstable warp-rifts. Then migrating through random warp travel. An ancient subspecies stripped of nearly all of there ancestors&#x2019; power and nobility. <br>
<br>
Exodite Megadon- SSI-4. Extremely variable breed of domesticated saurian. Found upon Exodite Maiden Worlds and bound to its World Spirit. With traits and behavior of each organism programmed by the Eldar. Originally created from the eggs of Stellar Dragons who served the Aeldari Empire<br>
<br>
Draugnirkin SSI-8.  Descendants of the ancient Stellar Dragon that guarded the Old One&#x2019;s World Nursery. Highly adaptable and capable of becoming entirely new subspecies within a few generations. Lesser shadows of true Stellar Drakes but still powerful.<br>
<br>
Ayidakin SSI-9. The children of Primarch Vulkans tamed Stellar Dragon Ayida. Born as variants of the Nocturne Fire Drake. Gifted energy from Vulkan or his Legions librarians allows them to evolve into full Stellar Dragons. Hatchlings are reared by the elite of the Dragonforged Legion. Starting to repopulate the Stellar Dragon species across the galactic core. <br>
<br>
Stellar Wyrms- SSI-6. Feral Stellar Dragons that haunt the farthest reaches of the Galaxy. Reproduce by feeding on psychic artifacts of the Old Ones. Hunted to near extinction by the Aeldari Empire and fellow children of the Ancients. Some were brought out of hiding by the presence of Ayida&#x2019;s children in the core worlds. <br>
<br>
Warp Dragons- SSI-? Stellar Drakes corrupted by the fell powers of the warp. Either drowned in Warp Storms during failed doom-dives. Exposed and mutated by agents of Chaos. Or most sinisterly by choice. Nonpossessed or Secondborn Warp Dragons are extremely rare. Most are now merrily shells for the Chaos Gods&apos; power. Corrupted but not daemonically controlled Dragons would be theoretically capable of reproducing by consuming sufficiently powerful chaos artifacts. <br>
<br>
Kalgalanokin- SSI-7. Born of the Fire Drakes stolen from Nocturne by the Dark Eldar. Bred and mutated by Haemonculi and Beast Masters into large varieties of reptilian horrors. Most feared of these are the Aelin-Drakes and Flayed Wyrms.</body></html>
