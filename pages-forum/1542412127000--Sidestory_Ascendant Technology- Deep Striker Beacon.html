<br>
<b>Name</b>- Deep Striker Beacons<br>
<br>
<b>Inventor/Manufacture</b>r- Magnus Rubricar and Odafin Vulkan invented with the Mechanicum manufacturing.<br>
<br>
<b>Purpose</b>- Single use rapid insertion Teleporter Beacon: Teleportation has long been a dangerous if useful technology. Shooting an object or being through an artificial warp-passage involves innumerable risks. The Deep Striker Beacon was designed to minimize these risks and allows soldiers to be and effectively enter the battlefield. With far greater accuracy and range than a standard Teleportation Homer.<br>
<br>
<b>Technological Description:</b> Mixing psionic and material technology the Deep Striker Beacon lets out a psychic pulse on activation. This pulse is uniquely attuned to Imperial Teleportariums and once the pulse comes into contact with a Teleportariums Warp-Core a link is formed. The Teleportarium then responds with its own pulse .these Psychic signals overlap and home in on each other. Forming a stable connection between the two points. Unlike traditional Teleportation that can be described as a bolt of lighting traveling through the Warp, Deep Striker Beacon teleportation is like a fast-moving current through the Warp. It is not nearly unpredictable and can allow for much longer range and accurate transportation.<br>
<br>
<b>Physical Description:</b> The current Prototype Beacon is a armored collum about 3/4 a meter in height and 15 centimeters in width. At its base is a deployable grounding spike. Which can be programmed to extend 35 cm on impact. At its top is an interface for cogitar inputs and a Lumen that change from Red when activated, Yellow when a bridge is formed, and Green when a teleportation is occurring. Additional flashing patterns occur when there is an issue.<br>
<br>
<b>Capabilities:</b> Where a traditional teleportation homer acts like &#x201C;lightning rod&#x201D; for a teleportariums warp-stream and is therefore very inaccurate with short range and prone to mishaps. The Deep Striker Beacon forms a one-way Warp-Current that smooths the passage and allows for a longer distance teleportation. Where orbit to surface Teleportations was a traditional device limit a Deep-Striker Beacon can reach AU&#x2019;s in distance. The stream nature of the connection between Teleportarium and beacon also vastly increases accuracy and virtually eliminates chances of a mishap.<br>
<br>
<b>Limits: </b>The major downsides to the Beacon come in a few categories. First is the danger of disruption. If the Beacon is damaged the bridge will be broken, stranding the passenger in the Warp at worst or shooting them into realspace somewhere in the gross vicinity of the beacon at best. Second, the creation and dissolution of this Warp-Current can only be done once due to power and mechanical limitations. Once it is used the Beacon must be reset by a trained Tech-Priest or Marine. Lastly the presence of the beacon itself, Teleportariums can &#x201C;estimate&#x201D; without a Homer and can be used to rapidly deploy and end a battle before it even begins. The Deep Strike Beacon requires someone or something to deploy it. Making it a tool of reinforcement and blitzkrieg, not decapitation strikes.<div class="sidenav-right"><a type="button" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="C:\data\projects\ascendant\pages-edited\1513216296000--Threadmarks_Chapter One.html"></a></div></div></body></html>
