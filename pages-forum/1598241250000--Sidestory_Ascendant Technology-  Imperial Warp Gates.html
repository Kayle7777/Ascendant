A piece of Xeno technology in process of being Reclaimed by the Mechanicum<br>
<br>
<b>Name: </b>Imperial Warp Gate<br>
<br>
<b>Inventor/Manufacturer: </b>Product of Mechanicum intellectual Reclamation projects, with aid from the Navis Nobility and Adeptus Psi. <br>
<br>
<b>Origin:</b> In the early years of the Xenocide and Beast Wars the power of the Xeno technology became rapidly apparent. With both enemy species using stable warp-rifts and tunnels to gain a mobility advantage over the Imperium. A group of radical Tech-Priests broached the idea of using these Xeno technologies. With initial studies of Rangda Wormgates and Orkish subspace tunnels showing potential for reverse-engineering. Mechanicum hardliners strenuously objected and political strife threatened the productivity of multiple Forgeworlds. This brief and minor schism came to an end when Adepts of the Adeptus Psi. (Master Adeptus of the Astronomicon, Telepathica, Psykana, League of Black ships and theoretically the Navis Nobility) demonstrated similarities between First Age of Technology Warp Gates found across the Imperium and the Xeno technology. Mechanicum moderates find a compromise and declare the Xeno technology as Heretek based on stolen human inventions. Gaps in understanding of the Warp Gates are filled with reclaimed knowledge and the process to construct new gates is started.<br>
<br>
<b>Purpose and Potential: </b>An Imperial Warp Gate is in short a stabilized and secured Warp rift. Providing a controllable entry and exit point for Warp travel. Allowing ships to bypass systems Mandeville points and reduce stress on its Warp Drive. Ensuring faster and more efficient movement of Imperial vessels. Gates typically measure less than a dozen kilometers in diameter. Limiting the size of fleets entering and exiting. By design Imperial Gates are relatively fragile. Capable of being destroyed with well-aimed fire from a single Imperial Cruiser. The production cost for Gates is high and they are only found in the most critical systems to the Imperium. Gates are multipart creations. With a localized macro Warp Drive making up the heart of it. Protected by two-fold Gellar Fields aligned to Anathemic and Chaotic energies respectively. The Anathemic Gellar Field acting as a moat, stopping the Astronimcons Firetide from burning away the Warp rift. The Chaotic Gellar Field creating an area of solidified realspace at the edge of the Rift. Forcing the Rift to form in a controllable space. Linked together the Gellar Fields will both collapse if one is destroyed. Resulting in the moat breaking and a flood of the Emperor&apos;s light crashing into the now unstable Warp-rift. This ensuing clash and explosion is capable of banishing most Neverborn and destroying Voidcraft close to the Warp Gate.<br>
<br>
<b>Appearance: </b>Gates are composed of a series of interlocking rings set inside each other. With the largest defense ring forming the exterior. Then inside of it is the Anathemic Gellar Rings, Pariah Ring, Chaotic Gellar Ring, and finally the Warp Rift&apos;s generator. When not in use the Rings spin at different rates and directions. Protecting the Warp Rift from any rogue entry or exit. When an approved vessel is moving to pass through the Gate. Its component rings align into a single circlet.<br>
<br>
<b>Manufacturing: </b>The majority of the materials used in creating Warp Gates are not dissimilar from those found in Star Forts or Orbitals. With a few extremely exotic exceptions. The outer frame and Anathemic Gellar Field require Astral Crystals to function. A potent byproduct of Psykers aligned to the Emperor&apos;s power. Slowly generated by the Astronomicon and its Choir. Forming fine golden dust found within the Hollow mountain and connected parts of the Imperial Palace. This dust can also be found in the Chamber of Rebirth on Titan and in the brains of Astropaths and other soulbound Psykers. Gathering enough of it to form the needed Crystals is difficult and demand of them is high. The other rare ingredient is a Pariah substance. Be it negatively charged Blackstone or the remains of Sisters of Silence and Culexus Assassins. While only needed in very small quantities the Pariah substance creates a buffer zone between the two Gellar Fields where the laws of physics are absolute. Psykers passing through Warp Gates may experience a split second of terror and pain due to the Pariah Ring. This can be combated with sedatives or sufficient focus.<div class="sidenav-right"><a type="button" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="1513216296000--Threadmarks_Chapter One.html"></a></div></div></body></html>
