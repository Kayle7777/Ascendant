So I decided to do the rest of the Primarch results in single chunks so expect them as minor asides in between chapters. <br>
<br>
Also yeah Primarch XI is Mala- I mean Malice. The reason I went with the Sons of Malice being the XI Legion aside from the obvious XI = Malal stuff was the Cannibalistic practices of the Sons explains a few things with the other legions.<br>
<br>
For instance Sanguinius really worried about his Legion being Purged because of the Red Thirst, fearing the mutation would spell there doom. Seems weird considering stuff like the Wulfen, the Flesh-Change or the Salamanders appearance didn&apos;t get those legions the Axe. <br>
I speculated the reason must be that one of the lost legions had to have had a mutation similar to the Red Thirst. Something that made them lose control and commit atrocities. Which of course lined up with the Sons of Malice. Sanguinius probably saw his Brother and his sons decay into feral cannibal monsters and how they needed to be put down and feared having the same occur with him and his legion.<div class="sidenav-right"><a type="button" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="C:\data\projects\ascendant\pages-edited\1513216296000--Threadmarks_Chapter One.html"></a></div></div></body></html>
