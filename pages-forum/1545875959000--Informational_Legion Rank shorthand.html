Chapter 19 pt 2 is coming along, no idea how long this segment will be but its gonna be fun.<br>
<br>
I wanted to post a little thing on Legion rank Shorthand. To help make some things make sense. I came up with a simpler way of describing an Astartes rank. We will be Using Chapter Master Ezekyle Abbadon for this example.<br>
<br>
Master Abbadon XVI-I-II-0-0-Cohort-Alpha<br>
1. Rank or position so stuff like Battle-Brother or Techmarine.<br>
<br>
2. the Ascension Name. When an Astartes is fully grown they pick a new last name to signify their place as an Angel of Death. This is often done because Battle-Brothers cannot remember their old family name. Abaddon kept his Chthonian Gang-name due to remembering it and wanting to keep a connection to his first tribe.<br>
<br>
3. the Legion Number.<br>
<br>
4. The Formation they belong to. All Astartes even ones not operating in a Formation structure are assigned to one. Allowing them to take up that role if needed.<br>
<br>
5. The Chapter they belong too if this is not applicable a Zero is marked instead<br>
<br>
6. The company they belong to, if this is not applicable a Zero is marked instead<br>
<br>
7. The Squad they belong to, if this is not applicable a Zero is marked instead.<br>
<br>
8./9. The Cohort they are part of. Listed last because it is the one most likely to shift. <br>
<br>
Yes, it&apos;s complicated and Neurotic. What else do you expect from the Imperium of Man?<div class="sidenav-right"><a type="button" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="C:\data\projects\ascendant\pages-forum\1547030323000--Threadmarks_Chapter Nineteen (Part II).html"></a></div></div></body></html>
