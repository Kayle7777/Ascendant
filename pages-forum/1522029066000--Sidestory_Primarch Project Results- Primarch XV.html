<br>
Primarch: XV Magnus the Red.<br>
<br>
Foster World:  Prospero- Civilized World settled by Exiles fleeing the Psi-Wars of Terra. Plagued by Warp-Parasites that Magnus lead the extermination of. Prospero was rebuilt by XV as a place of culture and learning where its Psyker population could live in peace. <br>
<br>
Discovery: 9th, Psychically detected traveling the Immaterium in a reckless fashion. Joined peacefully and given warning of the Warp. Attempted to solve Legions mutation and made a bargain with PA9, lost an Eye and became marked as property by the Warp Entity.<br>
<br>
Capabilities: Alpha Plus Psyker of extreme power and control. One of the greatest intellects of the Primarchs with a thirst for knowledge both practical and theoretical. Extremely arrogant due to powers and ignored warnings. Possesed the capabilities but not the aptitude to become the Throne-Lord.<br>
<br>
Legion: Thousand Sons- Geneseed enhances existing psychic potential and can unlock dormant sensitivity. Suffered from extreme mutation related to Warp-Corruption. Stabilised by XV and began to master Warp-Craft. Bound hostile Warp Entities to themselves and engaged in Sorcery <br>
<br>
Heresy: Loyal/Traitor Discovered XVI&#x2019;s corruption and attempted to prove merits of Sorcery by contacting us on the Throne, his Psi-signature allowed him to puncture the wards and rip open the Throne-Gate. VI sent to apprehend him in order to have another Gate-Holder. XVI&#x2019;s tampering and VI&#x2019;s errors caused calamity (See Burning of Prospero) <br>
<br>
Fate: Psyche shattered by ritual on Prospero, 65% of original Soul fused with PA9&#x2019;s power to create a God-Thrall known as the Crimson King. The remaining 35% either fused with our Oversoul or became the core of the First Lord of Titan. <br>
<br>
Conclusion: Extreme Failure- Despite or maybe because his many gifts he displayed worrying egotistical tendencies while being overconfident in his knowledge and power. Refused our advice, became bound to PA9 and was used to ruin the primary golden path. <br>
<br>
*Our Lord of Ways... Ended our path.... irony... Only by our blood....could they ruin the gate*</div>
