<b>The Legio Astartes </b></span><br>
<br>
&#x201C;They are my bulwark against the Terror. They are the Defenders of Humanity. They are my Space Marines and they shall know no fear.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 1.375rem"><b>Crusader Fleets and Expedition Fleets </b></span><br>
<b><br>
Crusader Fleets</b>- The vast majority of the Legio Astartes are organized in Twenty massive forces known as the Crusader Fleets. Containing 80-90% of all Astartes in a Legion each Crusader Fleet acts as an unparalleled military force capable of waging war against any Xeno or Noncompliant Empire.<br>
<br>
Commanded by a Primarch each Fleet is supported by multiple Titan Legions, Imperial Auxilla Regiments, and Iterator Courts. With the Legio Astartes forming the main fighting force and backbone of Crusade Fleet.<br>
<br>
The purpose and goal of each Crusade Fleet is to eliminate major threats to the Imperium. A list of high-priority targets compiled by the Emperor was presented to each Primarch at the start of the Crusade. The lists are unique to the Primarch they were given too and the foes detailed within would fall to that Primarchs and their legions talents.<br>
<br>
Each Crusader Fleet numbers in the hundreds of vessels, from titanic Gloriana Flagships to swarms of small escort crafts. Millions of Humans live and work in the fleet. This number includes the Fleets Legion. The Legion is required to maintain at least 500,000 Battle-Brothers and if casualties dip the number below that reinforcements from Expedition fleets will be called in.<br>
<br>
Periodically Crusader Astartes will be deployed to Expedition fleets and vice versa. This helps prevent complacency, overtaxed forces, and intra-legion rifts. These periodic changes help disrupt the formation of possibly corrupting secret-societies and helps forge positive bonds between Astartes and baseline humans.<br>
<br>
Organized into Ten specialized Super-Formations with unique names in each Legion the Crusader Astartes are capable of mobilizing and organizing successfully hundreds of thousands and in some cases millions of Astartes in a single battle. The Super-Formations are designed to specialize in a certain type of warfare and depending on a Legions own specialty some might be far larger than others.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Expedition Fleets</b>- Far smaller and far more numerous than the Crusader Fleets the Expedition Fleets exist as the Imperium&apos;s primary Unification force. Composed of Martian Explorators, Imperial Auxilia, Iraetor Courts and a token Astartes Force the Expedition Fleets are meant for exploration and diplomacy.<br>
<br>
Expedition Fleets form the third wave of Imperial expansion. First Rogue Traders who often time are involved with the fleets survey and scout a galactic region. The Crusader Fleets then eliminate any major threats in the region. The Expedition fleets than mop up any lesser dangers establish contact with the region&apos;s cultures and work to integrate them into the Imperium. Expedition Fleets also give the all clear for civilian vessels from Colony ships too Mining Charters to use new Imperial Space.<br>
<br>
Crusader Fleets are typically accompanied by several Expedition Fleets when operating between Crusade-Fronts. It is not uncommon for some of the more politically minded Primarchs too bring their Fleet during combat lulls or periods of repair and refit along with Expeditions. To help ease negotiations and tour the growing Imperium.<br>
<br>
Unlike Crusader Fleets that are commanded by a Primarch, an expedition fleet is commanded by a human commander. These Expedition Captains as they are called are often minor Imperial celebrities and are often recruited from Terran noble houses and Auxilia officer corps. To get this command strong force of will along with extreme competence is required. They are one of the few non-Astartes that can give orders to the Emperors Angels of Death.<br>
<br>
Each Expedition Fleet is garrisoned with a contingent of Astartes. The size of this garrison ranges from 200 to 20,000 depending on the size of the Expedition fleet and the hostility of the space they are traveling. The reason for this particular number is representatives of all twenty Legions are required in each fleet. Ranging from a single Squad to an entire Chapter.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 1.375rem"><b>Rank</b></span><br>
(This is a generalized system with sub-ranks and specialty ranks existing in various Legions. Such as Marshal-Lieutenants, Chapter Commander and)  <br>
<ol>
<li data-xf-list-type="ol">Neophyte- An Astartes in training. Lacking some Implants but combat ready. Organized into Training companies presided over by Scout Sergeants. Training companies duties depend on Legion. Ranging from scout work to being apprenticed under a Battle-Brother.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ol">Battle Brother- Rank and File Astartes that have completed their Training and assigned to a Super-Formation. Organized into Ten Man squads that act as a close-knit unit. Some battle brothers with particular talents are removed from the normal chain of command and become a Specialist that exist outside of typical squad command.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ol">Marshal-Sergeant- Officer and leader of a Battle-Brother Squad. Typically the eldest of the Squad with the most experience. The Veterans of hundreds of battles a Marshal-Sergeant will be sometimes be reassigned to train Neophytes as a Scout-Sergeant.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ol">Captain- Officer of a Hundred Battle-Brother strong Company. Each is a skilled commander capable of making independent decisions and leading a company into battle. Captains are also the lowest rank capable of commanding a vessel or an Expedition Contingent. If less than a company of each legion is deployed to an Expedition Fleet a Captain will be selected to have operational command over all the Astartes.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ol">Chapter Master- Elite officers who are in charge of commanding ten companies and all required support staff. These are the commanders of the Legio Astartes who direct battles and command respect. Chapter Masters are typically elected by a Chapters Captains but it&apos;s not unheard of them being appointed by higher-ups in times of emergency.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ol">Lord Commander- The Generals of the Legio Astartes, they command Cohorts and excel at getting multiple Super-Formations to work together in unison. Trusted by their Primarch with command over an entire theater of operations.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ol">Battlemaster- Handpicked by the Legions Primarch to lead a Super-Formation. These Space Marines are absolute masters of a certain type of warfare.<br>
<br>

<li data-xf-list-type="ol">Primarch- The Gene Father and absolute commander of a legion. Second only to the Emperor himself in military matters.</li>
</ol><br>
<span style="font-size: 1.375rem"><b>Basic Combat Organization</b></span><br>
<br>
<b>Squadron-</b> A Space Marine squad is composed of nine battle brothers and a Sergeant. The Astartes fight together as a unit and will fight and die for each other. Squads can either be specialist squads consisting of a single loadout or diversified squads of varying loadouts.<br>
 <br>
<b>Company</b>- Composed of ten squads, twenty support Astartes, and a Captain. Form the basic combat force of an Astartes and are designed to be equally effective operating independently or part of a larger force. A Company is trained to be able to rapidly shift from self-sufficient commando force to specialized military battalion. As such Companies are typically formed of squads with similar and complementary skills.<br>
<br>
<b>Chapter</b>- Ten Companies and support ranging from Armor columns to assigned Auxilia Regiments form a Legio Astartes Chapter. Similar to the companies that compose them Chapters are meant to be able to operate as independent armies or part of a specialized formation. Chapters typically are given nicknames based on their unique characteristics and specialties.<br>
<br>
<b>Cohort</b>- Five to fifty Chapters of Astartes working together as a single army. Typically composed of multiple super-formation Chapters working in concert to support each other. In rare cases a Cohort of a single Super-Formation may be deployed as needed though. A Cohort forms a theatre of operations for an Astartes Legion and its size varies on the intensity and importance of said conflict.<br>
<br>
<b>Super Formation</b>- A large number of specialized Chapters unified together into a single Legion-wide formation. Can be deployed in its entirety under a Battlemaster with Lord Commander lieutenant or in part under an appointed Lord Commander Designed to operate on massive battlefields against millions of foes the Super-Formations allow the skills of its Legion to be used to its fullest. While smaller deployments are designed to be both special forces and part of a larger army the Super-Formations are meant to fight solely as part of a legion, reliant on other Formations and much more specialized.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 1.375rem"><b>The Super-Formations </b></span><br>
<br>
<b>The First Formation</b>-<b> Elites</b> Amazingly skilled warriors selected for the most difficult duties and missions. Unlike the other formations, they are not assigned from training but are elevated to the First Formation after displays of martial skill, valor and legion values. Armed and equipped with the finest wargear available to the Legion masters of every skill set used in legion make up the First Formation. In combat, the First Formation is often used as an elite strike force to turn the tide of a battle or end it decisively. Out of combat they often have the duty of forming honor guards and attending diplomatic functions as a demonstration of Imperial force. The Astartes of the first formation are the most likely to fight alongside their Primarch, and typically two to three chapters of this formation are always deployed alongside their genefather.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>The Second Formation</b>-<b>Warsuits.</b> Each member is armored head to toe in Advanced Power Armor. Smaller than most other Formations due to limited numbers of tactical dreadnought armor, Centurion suits, and Dreadknights. Specialize in wading into the thickest of the fighting to inflict and take massive amounts of damage. Heavily armed and armored for spear tip strikes and frontal assaults. The Second Formation is deployed in two manners. In units of heavy shock troopers or single troops deployed within other formations to provide support.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>The Third Formation</b>- <b>Fast Attack</b>. Composed of Bike Cavalry and Jetpack specialists the Third Formation strikes hard and fast. Prizing mobility and efficiency the third Formation&#x2019;s duties is to start a battle on the Imperiums terms and keep the enemy formation broken. Fast Attack war-bikes and Jet-Bikes typically form a lighting fast blitz-force capable of ripping through the enemy line and opening them up to further attacks. The Jump Infantry of the Third Formation is sometimes deployed alongside their cavalry brothers to decimate disoriented pockets of enemies. At other times they are deployed piecemeal throughout the battle to act as fast-moving reinforcements to patch breaks in the battle-lines or harass enemy flanks.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>The Fourth Formation</b>- <b>Armored Assault.</b> The Fourth Formation operates the armored transports and tanks of the Legion. Transporting troops to the front lines and using the crushing power of heavy tanks to break the enemy are the duties of the Fourth formation. Each legions fleet of battle tanks, APC&#x2019;s and skimmers is operated by the Fourth Formation to great effect. Some of the more mechanized Legions like the IV and X boast massive numbers of these vehicles and equally large Fourth Formations to operate them. Different Legions prefer to use the Fourth Formation in unique ways. Some prefer the armored tank-lines be used independently to engage a blitzkrieg strategy. Others prefer the more reliable force multiplying effect of them supporting infantry.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>The Fifth Formation</b>- <b>Basic Infantry</b>. Almost always the largest Formation the Basic Infantry form the core of a Legion. These are the battle-brothers holding the line and doing the majority of the fighting. Composed of Astartes lacking the skills or interest to join one of the more specialized formations the Fifth Formation is known for being more adaptable and more efficient than its siblings. Where other formations might win a battle the Basic Infantry wins Wars. Equipped similarly to expedition fleet chapters they wield Standard Issue weapons, armor, and equipment. This formations squads similar to a Chapters can share a single loadout or have more diversified one&#x2019;s per battle-brother and war-zone need.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>The Sixth Formation</b>- <b>Close Quarter Combat</b>. Brutal warriors whose Modus operandi involves getting into the thickest of the fighting and reaping a grim toll upon the foe. By nature of their role, the Sixth Formation suffers higher casualties than virtually any other on average. This is counterbalanced by its atypical recruitment numbers. Many young battle-brothers seek to bloody themselves up close to the xeno-hordes. This is also the reason it is one of the most transferred out of formations. Veterans typically mature past their bloodlust and seek to serve the Imperium in other ways. Typically work closely with the Fifth Formation in holding the front lines.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>The Seventh Formation</b>- <b>Destroyers</b>. The grimmest and most brutal Formation the Seventh hold the combat role of heavy weapon and total warfare specialists. Collateral damage is an inevitable part of warfare. The other formations acknowledge this and seek to minimize it, this is not the case with the Seventh. Extremely destructive weaponry and relentless extermination are the duties of this formation. Like the second formation, they are typically deployed piecemeal throughout other formations to support them with overwhelming firepower and for the other formation to keep them in check. In the rare cases where the raw annihilating power of the Seventh is needed in its entirety, they can assemble and reduce cities to ash.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>The Eighth Formation</b>- <b>Void Specialists</b>. Legio Astartes translates to Legion of the Stars, this is the origin of the coequal civilian term for the Emperors Angels: The Space Marines. Void warfare is a brutal unforgiving practice that the Eighth Formation is designed to handle. Divided into two rough sub-formations the Eighth form both a Legions pilots for their transport and attack crafts, while also performing boarding operations. Either piloting a stormbird or marching through an enemy vessels hallway stormshield in hand the Eighth Formation ensure the Imperium alone is master of the Void. The Armor and weapons of the Eighth Formation are designed to allow effective fighting in the confines of Voidships and surviving the dangers of collapsing vessels and the unforgiving void.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>The Ninth Formation</b>- <b>Defensive Warfare</b>. War is Hell, the Ninth Formation know that better than most and are meant to not only survive but thrive in that environment. The building and garrisoning of Fortresses falls to the Ninth Formation. Attrition warfare, artillery and defending a Legions supply lines also fall under the Ninth formations purview. This leads to a somber and pragmatic attitude to these heavily armed and armored battle brothers. While other formations may capture territory the Ninth ensures they keep that territory.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>The Tenth Formation</b>- <b>Specialists and Logistics</b>. Not so much a single formation but a blanket term to cover and classify the countless specialists and support-Astartes that operate inside a Legion. These include the Libarius, Chaplaincy Corp, Tech-Marines, Apothecaries, Emperors Talons detachment, Silver Order Detachment,  Muster Chiefs, Scouts and the neophytes. The training and recruitment of new Astartes for the Legion falls under the Tenth Formations duties. Once they finish their training in the Tenth they are assigned to another formation or expedition fleet.</div>
