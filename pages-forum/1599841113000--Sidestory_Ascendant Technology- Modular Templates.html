<b>Name: </b>Modular Template Design Schema (MTD) <br>
<br>
<b>Inventor/Manufacturer: </b>Developed by Forge-World Phaeton with Martian oversight. Now distributed to all compliant military Manufactorum.<br>
<br>
<b>Origin: </b>As the Great Crusade expanded outward and new Forge Worlds joined the Imperium or were established. A number of new logistical challenges faced the growing Imperium. Many of them originating in the complexities of uniting disparate Forge Worlds in doctrine. Chief among these was the problem of disparate Patterns. Virtually every Forge-World or Manufactorum brought into the Imperium added new Patterns, pre-existing STC&apos;s for specific models of a machine. Centuries of Doctrine and a healthy distaste for experimentation and change prevented Forge Worlds from changing what Patterns they manufactured. Unwilling to produce untested foreign Patterns, or incorporate new manufacturing processes. Resulting in each major Forge World producing equipment that proved incompatible with similar machinery manufactured on a different Forge World. Forcing Crusade Tech-Priests to jury-rig repairs and replacement parts if they were not in contact with the machine origin forge. This undue stress on Imperial logistics along with the inevitable fallout of irate Machine Spirits feeling violated by foreign modifications could not continue. Tech-Priests of Forge World Phaeton developed a solution in modular equipment, which with Mars&apos; blessing quickly spread across the Imperium<br>
<br>
<b>Purpose and Potential: </b>Imperial Modular Template Designs is a return to the ancient styles of Dark Age STC&apos;s. Stripping different vehicle patterns down to the base hull and making them highly customizable as they were intended to be. Traditional fabrication following STC protocol &quot;prints&quot; a completed vehicle of a specific pattern instead of a modular system. Often with built-in systems and arcane ritual-programs that proved incompatible with other machinery. The Modular Template Design Schema allows a Forge World to mass-produce the frame of a vehicle along with a variety of equipable modules. Ensuring near-universal cross-compatibility of all parts belonging to a specific vehicle class or purpose. An additional perk of this system is the streamlining of Imperial vehicle classifications. With equipment organized on three different levels.<br>
<br>
<b>Basic Organization of Imperial Equipment</b><br>
<br>
1. Class - The most basic purpose and hull/frame/blueprint of this piece of equipment.  Every class is designed around a general-purpose. Be it Combat Vehicle, Civilian Transport, Star Frigate, Infantry Weapon, etc.  The &quot;RH1 N0&quot; or Rhino Craft being a well known Combat Vehicle Class.<br>
<br>
2. Model - A sub-class designed for a particular purpose. More specific and specialized than its base class. Many vehicles once considered independent crafts have been folded into the model division. For example, the Predator Tank and Razorback Transport are Models of the Rhino Craft. Taking the base model and equipping it with modules designed for a particular role that differentiates it from the base class.<br>
<br>
3. Patterns - The specific loadout and equipment meant for a situation. The preexisting STC patterns are used as a basic guide for loadouts and effective equipment. Examples include the Destructor and Annihilator Predator Tanks which are equipped for different combat situations. Newly discovered Patterns are still very valuable. Providing instructions for new modular loadouts and ways to appease the machine spirits of equipment rebuilt with new modules. <br>
<br>
<b>Future Plans: </b>By returning to the pre-Age of Strife modular equipment style the Imperium hopes to ensure stable production and distribution of equipment. Escaping some of the Cargo-Cult tendencies of the Adeptus Mars. While still using the accumulated knowledge and resources of the Forge-Worlds. Another definite benefit of the MTD schema is the broken apart nature of the instructions provided. Instead of providing an exact blueprint for a single Pattern, the MTD gives a less complicated summary of the equipment creation and purpose. Allowing for less reliance on a centralized database like the STC&apos;s of old. The Lexicanium is being constantly updated with MTD&apos;s and spreading acquired knowledge across the growing Imperium. The new system of Modular design also encourages some level of experimentation and creativity when it comes to constructing and using equipment. Reintroducing lost concepts to the Adeptus Mars in a safe manner acceptable to all but the most hardline Tech-Priests.<div class="sidenav-right"><a type="button" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="1602500425000--Threadmarks_Chapter Twenty-Five (Part III).html"></a></div></div></body></html>
