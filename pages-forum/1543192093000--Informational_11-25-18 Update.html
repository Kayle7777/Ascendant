So chapter 19 might be a week or two away. On the bright side, a project I am working on for a class is a horror short story that I will probably publish here as a sort of apology for the delay if you all would not mind. Its called the Flesh Golem, a cyberpunk detective mystery involving the fallout of corporate sponsored transhumanism. <br>

Also on Imperium Ascendent news, I have a game plan for Chapters 19-21 and the Legion profiles. Chapters are probably going to be 3-4 parters from here on out so expect longer and more detailed storylines. Chapter 19 and 20 will also have some focus on Marcus Augustio, Horus Lupercali Kalib Kraad, and their respective Legions. With Chapter 21 focusing on the Custodes, the Emperor, Iskandar and his legion. Try to figure out what incident involves all of those groups. It&apos;s in canon and a Phoenix will rise!<div class="sidenav-right"><a type="button" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="1543817606000--Sidestory_The Monsters in the Alley (Non-40k story).html"></a></div></div></body></html>
