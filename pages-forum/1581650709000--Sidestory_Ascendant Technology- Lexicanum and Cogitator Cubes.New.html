    <b>Name: </b>Lexicanum and Cogitator Cubes<br />
    <br />
    <b>Inventor/Manufacturer:</b> Created in a partnership between the bureaucratic wings of the Adeptus Terra and
    Adeptus Mars.<br />
    <br />
    <b>Origin of the Lexicanum: </b>The Great Crusade and growing Imperium required more advanced data storage and
    retrieval methods. In order to deal with the rapidly increasing complexity of Imperial logistics and data. Martian
    Datalooms and Terran Archives were proving both insufficient. At the command of the Sigillite, the Adeptus Terra and
    Adeptus Mars worked together to develop a new system. After years of experimentation, the first version of the
    Lexicanum was developed. Using designs based on Golden Age designs discovered in the Kebira Crater complex,
    Sigillite Order engram systems, and Martian binary cant. The Lexicanum is an impossibly advanced archival system
    that is designed to hold the sum total of Mankinds knowledge. A reimagination of the STC and Neurosphere database of
    the Golden Age. Where the Neurosphere relied on warp based pathways that held the Akasha Library and its Standard
    Template Archive. The Lexicanum was designed to be entirely material in nature and extremely compartmentalized.<br />
    <br />
    <b>Lexicanum Cogitator Cubes: </b>A key part of this system of data storage was the development of Cogitator Cubes
    or &quot;Bone-Gems&quot; as they are sometimes called. Martian advancements with fractal coding allowed for the
    inscription of petabytes of data into a crystalline matric. Allowing the Imperium to create crystals that are
    infused with a binary cant that is easily translatable with anything from crude las-readers to anyone with knowledge
    of the language/code/system and a microvisualiser. Systems like this had been tried before but had failed due to
    silicon corruption from Abominable Intelligence or Warp Predator interference. A Martian Genetor discovered the
    solution to this issue. Hydroxyapatite, the calcium crystal found in organic bones could be used instead of silicon
    or carbon crystals. Cloned or naturally sourced human bone could be rendered down and rebuilt as techno-organic
    Cogitator Cubes. The organic nature and sanctification process used in the creation of these &quot;bone gems&quot;
    protected them from all but the most extreme Warp Exposure and Abominable Intelligence tampering.<br />
    <br />
    <b>The Lexicanum Database: </b>The limit to the size and storage space of these Cogitator Cubes is theoretically
    near infinite. Lesser cubes are capable of being assimilated into much larger Macro-Cogitator systems. Then this
    data can be copied into another Cube or transferred. Leading to the development of massive Data-Vaults across the
    Imperium where hab-block sized cubes contain sectors worth of information. This data can be easily copied into
    smaller less impressive cubes as needed. With them ranging from barely visible cogitator-grains, palm-sized personal
    recorders to the great Ossuary Archive of Mars that is believed to hold the sum total of the Imperiums knowledge.
    This system of copied and distributed data is linked together as the Lexicanum. With new information transferred and
    updated across the Imperium in a huge network of intelligence. Armies of cloned psychic brains guided by an
    Astropathic Choir can be used to transfer the raw binary data of these cubes as needed across the galaxy. These
    beams of hyper-dense spiritually translated binary traverse the Immaterium as psychic-lasers capable of cutting
    through minor warp-disturbance. These Lex-Arrays act as a supplementary system to the Astropathic network. Used for
    the transfer of large quantities of data. More important or smaller amounts of information are transferred by cube
    to cube audits and Astorpathic Choirs. Imperial worlds and vessels possess large Lexicanum Data-troves that are
    constantly updated by the resident Tech-Priests. This information is then transferred along with the Worlds Tithe or
    in ships case. When the vessel docks at an Imperial port. All this information feeds into the massive archival
    system that forms in a web from the Sol System outwards. Attached to the existing Astropathic relay system. This
    system of continuous communication and archiving of information makes it so important data ranging from Imperial
    Laws to STC designs are easily available across the Imperium. Connecting the new galactic human civilization and
    creating large deposits of information as needed.<br />
    <br />
    <b>Data Rating: </b>Not all information is created equal and the Lexicanum uses two axis to rate it. Making it so
    every file or &quot;grain&quot; as they are called is rated by its importance and level of security. These two
    matrixes are rated 1 to 100. With 1 being the least important/classified and 100 being the most. Files are typically
    marked with a binary marker of some kind and a pair of numbers laying out the data rating. For example
    &quot;file-name 5:58 Would be a minimum important piece of information that is fairly classified. This system makes
    it so a Cube can have hundreds of different files but only a portion of them accessible to the public. Requiring an
    authorization ranging from finger-print to neural scan or more to open the classified ones. The Importance rating is
    used for deciding the speed a &quot;grain&quot; should be sent. With it being placed in Astropathic queue or
    Cube-Transferred as needed.
