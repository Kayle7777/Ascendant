<b>Xeno Amblicalius</b>: Jokaero (Pongo Indoles)<br>
<br>
<b>Threat Level: </b>Salutari-9<br>
<br>
<b>Habitable Zones and Behavior</b>: The Jokaero are one of the most curious species in the known galaxy. Imperial adepts long debated the origin of this designed species and its purpose. The common train of thought was they were another of the designed species of the Old Ones. Possibly designed as natural mechanics and inventors. While the curious technopathic abilities displayed seem synonymic with Old One creations. In truth, the Jokaero are a product of Silicon-Age Human technological innovation. Being in truth a modified species of the ancient Terran simian known as an Orang-u-Tan. The mistaking identification as an Old One creation is understandable, however. For the Jokaero were the product of a program to reverse engineer and recreate the Old One&apos;s techniques. Over the Milleina mankind quickly learned to fear the mad genius of the Orks and there natural technological proficiency. With generations of science-tests and wise-folk working to unlock the secrets of the Ork. While the full depth and complexity of the Old One&apos;s designs escaped mankind. Advents in early psychic technology and A.I. capable of handling the immense data coded within Orkish genetics and Collective-Consciousness. Allowed for primitive reproduction of the Orkish innate technological abilities. Cloned Orang-u-Tans, recreated from the fabled Noach Vaults were used in this process. Creating a new species that possessed an innate technological understanding. With intellect and technical abilities surpassing humans. This &quot;Joke&quot; of an Augmented Experimental Rebuilt Organism. Or A.E.R.O for short was also designed to have deficiencies in critical thinking and other higher-order mental tasks. Ensuring the experiment did not become a threat to humanity and was easily manipulatable. With the average Jokaero being not that much more complicated in its desires than an Orang-u-Tan. With reduced aggression and increased agreeableness, however. Eventually, the project was discontinued. With progress coming to a halt. The secrets of Old One biotech and psitech proved outside the domain of understanding. Thankfully the Jokaero&apos;s were saved from euthanization by a mysterious benefactor known as &quot;The Revelator.&quot; Who released multiple breeding colonies of the simians into the galactic wilds. These &quot;wild&quot; colonies quickly developed into technologically advanced tribes. That mastered space flight and spread out across the galaxy. Existing as a multitude of Jokaero clans that travel the galaxy. Constantly seeking new technological discoveries and safety.<br>
<br>
<b>Description: </b>Matching the appearance of ancient Orang-u-Tans the Jokaero is set apart from this ancient breed by two distinct factors. On inspection, the hands and feet of the Jokaero are far extremely dexterous. The Xeno&apos;s (Jokaero&apos;s are given this distinction for being sentient species of non-human descent) showing the ability to use its four manipulator limbs simultaneously with skill surpassing trained human professionals. Secondly, Jokaero&apos;s are almost always equipped with cybernetics and mechanical equipment. Only infants lacking any form of cybernetics. With more heavily augmented Jokaero usually acting as Patriarch or Matriarch of a clan or tribe. Personality-wise they are insatiably curious and generally friendly. Unless threatened they are more a danger to unintended machinery than humans. However, if the Jokaero feels it is in danger it will not hesitate to unleash its weapons. Usually a collection of digital-weapons that are often built into the Xeno. While lacking the ability to speak Gothic naturally, some Jokaero&apos;s undergo augmentation to there throat or brain. Allowing them to speak Gothic. Sign-Language is actually the main form of communication among Jokaero and non-Jokaero&apos;s. With the Language being remarkably complicated and requiring minor augments to hands and forelimbs for humans to speak it with mastery. Generally, the Jokaero co-exist within the Imperium as a protected vassal-species. Most Jokaero exist in tight-knit clans aboard a single spacecraft. Traveling the stars looking for resources to complete whatever projects the member Jokaero are working on. The distractable and in many ways simple-minded simians have proven difficult for Imperial diplomats to work with. Even so, a general agreement has been hammered out between the major tribes and the Adeptus Terra and Mars. With Jokaero ships being required to check in with the Imperial government whenever they enter or leave an inhabited system. Allowing for some level of tracking of the Species. As well the Jokaero are forbidden from unregulated trade or resource extraction. With Mechanicum worlds to act as trade-depots for Jokaero. Any resource or item needed by the Jokaero will be provided by the Imperium within reason. In exchange for Jokaero artifacts of similar value. Many Jokaero do choose to leave there communities and settle upon Imperial worlds and are prized by Mechanicum officials and Planetary Governors. Entire tribes or clans setting up residence in Imperial Space or on an Imperial World is not unheard of. With these Jokaero required to pay Imperial Tithe in the form of artifacts or service. In turn, the Jokaero can call upon the aid of the Imperium, gain access to vast stretches of protected void-space, along with satiating curiosity related to human technology without Imperial sanction.<br>
<br>
<b>Reproduction and Lifecycle:</b> Being simian mammals the Jokaero reproduce as such. With each clan entering into a mating season roughly every eight solar years. All sexually mature members of the species will enter this state. The clan will seek out another clan undergoing this process and its willing males and females will partner off to produce offspring. Resulting in a new generation of Jokaeros. It is believed this process is meant to diversify genes and provide a predictable mating schedule for the researchers who created the Jokaero. Offspring will go join the Mothers clan and are raised communally. Jokaero naturally live for around sixty solar years but can reach much longer ages due to extensive augments and medical technology. Social rank and desirability as a mate directly correlate to the complexity and ability of a Jokaero&apos;s invention. Leading to a primitive technocratic culture. In many ways, this species walks the line of animal and sentient. With it holding a mixture of innate skill and technological genius with a primitive simian outlook on life. Often caring more about satisfying its banal curiosity of how things work. Or tinkering with technology for there own amusement and pleasure. However, they are to never be underestimated. Older Jokaeros are legendarily cunning. With a primal wit mixed wit than an intricate understanding of technology. While thankfully preferring to avoid conflict and escape from dangerous situations. Jokaero are incredibly dangerous if they feel no other option is available. Especially in the lead up to the mating season. Where brash young males will go towards incredible lengths to create works of technological wonder. All in the name of gaining a mate.<br>
<br>
<b>Technology:</b> Where the Orks possess an innate understanding of technology and can produce deadly marvels from scrap. Orkish technology is legendarily unreliable and requires the gestalt WAAAGH!!! field to work properly. It is unknown if this is a design feature to combat the C&apos;tan&apos;s power to manipulate the laws of physics. Or simply another side effect of the weapon-race degrading without the Old Ones influence. By contrast, the process that created the Jokaero. Relied less on psychic imprinting and more on gene-born instincts. If an Ork Mekboy creates a Gargant it does so from a mix of a psychic fever-dream and snippets of instinctual knowledge. With the process being more akin to human artistry than human innovation. Jokaero could be better compared to an arachnid spinning its web or an avian learning to fly. They do know full well what they are doing and how to do it. Just now why they do it or where they learned to do it. In truth, Jokaero are living deposits of Silicon-Age techno-lore. That provides countless artifacts for mankind to reverse engineer. An organic equivalent to the great repositories of the STC and Akasaka Records. These allied Xenos possess the ability to produce miniaturized weapons and tools of incredible complexity. Intricate devices once only produced by A.I. controlled molecular-forges. Even the starships of the Jokaero are bizarre and powerful. With each clan-craft possessing maneuverability and firepower enough to fight off foes that outnumber and outgun them. Jokaero are capable of creating technological wonders that were only discovered with the use of godlike Artificial Intelligences. That can be recreated by skilled means but would remain lost to mankind when the Age of Strife arrived Unless preserved by a species of idiot-techno-savants with incredible capabilities. It is suiting that a light thrown into the future by near accident would come in the form of such a strange creature.<div class="sidenav-right"><a type="button" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="1513216296000--Threadmarks_Chapter One.html"></a></div></div></body></html>
