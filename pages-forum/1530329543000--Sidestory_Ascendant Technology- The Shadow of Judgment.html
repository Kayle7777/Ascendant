Name- Shadow of Judgment<br>
<br>
Inventor/Manufacturer- The Emperor of Mankind and Fenno Naur: Crafted during the tail end of the Iron War as a way to allow the Emperor subtle movement around the Galaxy during his exodus.<br>
<br>
Purpose- Stealth Suit: The Age of Strife was an era of insanity and conflict. Items, artifacts, and individuals needed to be gathered from across the Galaxy to give humanity a chance of survival. The Emperor knew exposing himself before he was ready would lead to calamity. To prevent this the Shadow of Judgment was created to allow him unrestricted access and near perfect secrecy in his endeavors.<br>
<br>
Technological Description: Woven of trillions of programmable Nano-gossamer strings each impregnated with microscopic Psi-reactive crystals. This allows a Psyker with sufficient control to shape the suit to their liking and power it. The Material is highly reactive and can shift itself to meet the wearer&apos;s needs. Be it generating melee weapons to masking energy signatures and disrupting scanning equipment.<br>
<br>
Physical Description: In its base state the Shadow appears like a pool of liquid darkness. The Nano-gossamer absorbs all light that touches it and is so flexible it seems almost liquid. When donned by its wearer its appearance varies depending on needs and personal choice. For the Emperor, it typically appears as a lightly armored war-suit with an Avian theme. Particularly the helm would appear like a Bird of Preys head.<br>
<br>
Capabilities: The Shadow of Judgment allows its wearers to bypass virtually any and all security measures. Be they psychic or material. The psychic crystals attune themselves to the wearer&apos;s warp signature and neutralize it. Jamming apparatus can be easily created by the suits nano-colonies. Any sound, heat or electromagnetic activity generated by the wearer is eliminated.<br>
<br>
Limits: The Nano-Gossamer threads can form different shapes and functions but are limited in both matter and energy supply. If damaged the suit is extraordinarily hard to repair and would take knowledge and skills virtually lost during the Age of Strife. Extreme levels of psychic control are also required to reach the suits full potential.<div class="sidenav-right"><a type="button" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="C:\data\projects\ascendant\pages-forum\1530710788000--Threadmarks_Chapter Sixteen (Part I).html"></a></div></div></body></html>
